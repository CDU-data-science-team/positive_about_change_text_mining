"Staff/Staff Attitude","Half hour checks cut back to one hour."
"Communication","More emphasis needs to be placed upon the opinions and views of the patient. Not all patients in mental Health are incapable of looking after themselves.

"Access to Services","Government cuts in helping people who struggle with forms has been cut. Make life so hard."
"Access to Services","As always it would be to have ""hands-on"" help 24/7 - not just a voice on the end of the phone - somewhere to take the person in distress to - to help them straight away -  it is a scary situation to be in - and you need help ""then"". Not just 9-5.00."

"Access to Services","More therapy sessions 30 is not enough!"
"Access to Services","I would of prefered seeing someone less frequently but over a longer period of time."
"Access to Services","Yes, every part of the early service for young people.  The appointments take too long, are too infrequent, the only reason I remain alive is that my parents paid for private care as I was actively suicidal."
"Care/ Treatment","Treatment should be tailored to suit needs not to fit in a budget and hence end abruptly."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was disappointed with the crisis team at Mulbrook Hospital when I felt desperate and suicidal. I was simply told to go home and have a nice relaxing bath as they felt hospital couldn't help. Luckily I got support elsewhere."
"Access to Services","The waiting times  are appalling, the mentally ill should not be made to wait for months on end before they are treated."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The amount of time with the therapist and group intervention and directio could be vastly improved in my group psychotherapy services progress feedback would be useful too."
"Access to Services","More sessiomns and when the sessions come to an end will have to go through same process of being on a long waiting list again before seeing someone.  Waiting list too long as had to wait over a year."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Yes! everything! Dr X at Milbrook is the most patronising person I have ever seen.  He speaks to me as if  I am a 5 year old.  He does not offer support or understand and talks at me as if I am a brainless bimbo. - which I am certainly not!! They just do not are - all they want is to discharge you."
"Communication","Please place some helpline numbers in reception area."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The whole experience of the ED service has been most unsatisfactory. We have had to fight every step of the way to get any sort of service for our daughter who is 19. Originally we had to contact our local MP and complaint to the Trust to get any sort of move on a placement for our daughter. Our first experience of the service in Novemember 2015 was poor and steadily went down hill from there. I had to push for my daughter to have an initail referral to inpatient services in 2016 as her key worker seemed happy to invite her for a follow up appointment two weeks later when her BMI was below 15. Our daugher was in an ED hospital for 8 months but when she came out all that was on offer was a once weekly appointment at Bassetlaw hospital. Having come from a 24/7 service this simply wasn't enough. Her psychologist was given clear guidelines regarding the point at which our daughter should be re-referred to in-patient services at her review which we attended. The consultant psychiatrist told her that if our daughter's BMI reached 15 then an immediate re-referral should be made. This did not happen and after my daughter started to express concerns about relapsing and allowed me to weigh her I discovered that her BMI was 13.7 and no referral had been made. When then had to contact the ED service and ask for a referral to be made. We were given an appointment with the psychiatrist in Nottingham (1 hour away from where we live) and are now waiting for a critical bed to come up. We have been informed that this is likely to be in Glasgow any day now as our daughter has become dangerously unwell. This Trust has no regular day service for ED. There is no crisis intervention service for ED so nobody to take a call at evenings or weekends when a crisis arises. On the one occasion when we were in one such crisis we called the Bassetlaw mental health crisis intervention team. They agreed to see our daughter at Bassetlaw A&E. Whilst the therapist who saw our daughter was very kind, she inadvertently triggered our daughter's anorexia due to a lack of experience of ED and made her much worse. The money that must be spent funding beds in other health authorities must be extortionate. It would be a fraction of this cost to provide more regular day care specialised services. We were informed by Leicestershire NHS that had we lived in or around Leicester, our daughter would have been able to access the day unit attached to their inpatient ED service following discharge. She may have had a better chance of long-term recovery and not required a further inpatient placement. Once again this would surely have saved the Trust money. If this scenario is being played out over and over again, the Trust must be losing huge amounts of money each year at the cost and wellbeing of the patients."
"Care/ Treatment","Ask about personal experiences so people can reassure you that this behaviour is not uncommon, also can help come up with plans you can do to get through the situation."
"Care/ Treatment","More specialised courses based upon prior ""taster"" courses?"
"Access to Services","Making sure there's more beds available in the trust, especially if they are informal patient and more comfortable beds. "
"Care/ Treatment","Focus on my mental health, not put me down, make me feel worse, make lies up, one home appointment the 'professional' didnt mention my mental health at all.
make me realise you cannot trust health professionals, feel completely let down."
"Care/ Treatment","Lack integrity with communications and support. Poor continuity in consultancy services and intervention support negligle."
"Access to Services","Stop cancelling appointments, having waited 7 weeks for an appointment, I have now been cancelled on twice. I now face another 2 week wait for another appointment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Reception Man is vile. Getting snot up from back of throat very loudly all the time."
"Access to Services","Provide more than six sessions if necessary."
"Food","Provide tea and biscuits between walks."
"Access to Services","I am extremely disappointed with this service. To cut a long story short, I had to wait over 15 weeks to get my first initial assessment CBT session. Then my therapist booked me in for his first appointment of the day each week, yet he was late by at least 20 minutes before each session. He had excuses such as traffic was bad etc. This put me off completely, as I was already nervous and anxious about the sessions, and I was made to feel the therapist didn't even care to turn up on time, and he had no excuse as that he ran over with another patient. Also, when I got my discharged letter through the post, the document went into extreme detail about everything that I had said. I would have much preferred it to just say things like ""discussed family issues"" ... rather than a letter detailing what I had said about my Dad or Mum in confidentiality! Luckily I got to the letter first, as my family can open each others letters! Furthermore, my therapist was a nice man, yet would talk far more than me, and did not even ask me questions such as ""how was your week?"", for me to express something huge that happened that week. To be honest, I am disgusted with the service, and I am very sad that mental health is not taken far more seriously. Due to the waiting time, I really just had to attempt to get better myself, yet I know for others in much worse circumstances, this would not be possible."
"Environment/Facilities","Hot water in clinc instead of a kettle."
"Care/ Treatment","No hot water in clinic tank gone. Have not had legs washed."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When needed other services maybe just telling you where to go I felt I could have needed a little more support with direction I need to go. "
"Communication","Turn up.  You could actually keep the appointment.  And if you can't, contact me before I leave for the appointment, and have in place a reception that knows what staff are, or are not in."
"Communication","Just communicate more of what you do. The service skill and care is outstanding yet so few people know what you do."
"Care/ Treatment","There was a couple of occasions where I nearly ran out of medication and had to ring the Crisis helpline to get more."
"Communication","More information about waiting times, was not much information at all about the expected wait"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The psychiatrist I saw had an unusual and unhelpful attitude towards me. I felt as though he had already formed his opinion about me before I entered the room and he did not help me to find better coping strategies. He was rude and made inappropriate comments. He also basically told me that i wasn't allowed to phone the crisis team if I felt unsafe out of hours. I felt that the psychiatrist did not listen to me at all and was not conducive to recovery."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Stop cutting back on our care groups."
"Access to Services","Longer courses, more detail"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A little confusing seeing different people each time, hard to remember who you've spoken too.  Sometime I felt misunderstood explaining the events in my life & had to reiterate. "
"Care/ Treatment","Get meds sorted faster and use the same meds as on the out. Cos I only get half the meds I should get. Checking if I swallowed my meds, I felt daft."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Be able to tell the prison how to treat us, they just lock us in and leave us when we get upset or angry. "
"Access to Services","I went on new medication, Paliperidone, in Jan 2015 & got better almost immediately.  i am still detained despite not even being on medication for the last three months. "

"Care/ Treatment","Try motivating patients to engage in extra curricular activities more for there own good."
"Care/ Treatment","More fresh air. "

"Care/ Treatment","Subject to structure, more social interaction with patients who present as compliant. A fairer distribution of what foods available. A variety of viewing on communal T.V. No monopolising."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Trust patients."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some staff are not respectful to patients. When patient are well we are not being moved forward."
"Environment/Facilities","Not enough technology like ps4 xbox1 DVD players etc."
"Access to Services","Improve waiting times answer healthcare apps. Had to wait weeks to be seen.  Healthcare staff do try it's doctors that are rubbish."
"Access to Services","Depends on what I'm filling this in for if for drug services more interaction.  Waited 8 weeks to see a triage nurse so that I was stressed, upset and brought my own antibiotic tretment off another in end and helaed myself after trying everything to be seen.  No one wants to listen fob you off put app in iof which you then hear nothing. We get appointment slips after appintments don't get picked up. Worst evert the nursing staff make you feel sub-human, dismiss you refuse to engage in any form of conversation.  Don't ever say moring etc basic manners. I feel worse an infection left scars on face which if treated when first brought up would of healed not spread or grown large.  "
"Care/ Treatment","More physio sessions."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More speech therapists -  not only do they provide excellent therapy, but their support  and encouragement is vital for both stroke survivors and careers."
"Access to Services","Keep the centres open and do not amalgamate any more"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","No support is provided to carers"
"Care/ Treatment","Actually give the immmunisation injection.  This is the second time it has been missed.  You won't let local Health centers administer, but can't do it yourselves. Managed to miss out the patient twice, failed to update paperwork."
"Communication","No more surveys. The nurses are too busy to fit this in. They shouldn't be expected to do it."
"Access to Services","I used to live in Milton Keynes and took my son to a sure start song group and no further help or support was offered."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","The whole service received from the let's talk team was shocking. "
"Access to Services","I heard that this facility will not continue after November which I think is such a shame. I have really enjoyed the drop in facility to weigh my baby and track his development and to talk to the health advisers, their knowledge has been so helpful."
"Care/ Treatment","Not to come late as the carers Staff are then behind."
"Care/ Treatment","Cure me. Stop me getting old."
"Communication","Improve community between staff - staff and staff- patient so carers know what or who to contact when needed. "
"Communication","Communication with carers and within the team."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A crisis situation should be recognised and acknowledged. I was suicidal and was told by X at County Crisis that if I wanted to kill myself, that was my decision. Basically exempting her responsibility if I was to kill myself."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Although I have attended clinic appointments with my daughter I have not been offered any support as a carer, so this should be offered."
"Communication","Clear written relevant information to take away. Too often, an appointment is rushed and information etc. is difficult to absorb and remember"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff required - the present team is too small for the job"
"Access to Services","A lot, things are always left to get worse before help is received but this is too late most of the time!"
"Communication","Dr X needs to stop treating patients as though they are text books and actually listen to them as individuals. Just because i dont have a diagnosis of Bi polar doesnt mean meds for that havent helped me in the past."
"Access to Services","The space between appointments, the changing of staff interferes with keeping a stable relationship (not good if you hate change). The system is lacking consistency and staff."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Although nice, some people I have found quite condescending. People's knowledge of services outside their own particular field. Lots of confusing info. Waiting times/time delay of treatment. Individual cases should be treated as individuals. Scrap template letters. Framework very poor at returning calls."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Unfortunately due to the lack of fundng for this service, the amount of time given is simply not enough!  You just get to trust your professional and then it stops. leaves you feeling very deflated."
"Access to Services","At the moment, I have to travel 13 miles to see my CPN and it would be better if I could see her locally."
"Communication","Crisis team are very triggering and don't listen."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think there could be more CPN's."
"Communication","Yes, I still dont understand the medication and why it needs increasing, I also dont understand what it is supposed to do. I am told it is supposed to stabalise my moods and thoughts but it doesnt seem to work."
"Access to Services","Waiting time desperately long, staff illness caused long interruptions, community support now non existent and only help via new referral from GP - with another long wait - so problems get worse.  Too much staff sickness probably caused by job pressures. Psychiatrist was dismissive and had no empathy and lost interest and changed appointments."
"Access to Services","We have been waiting for treatment for BPD for 9 months. Our phone calls are not dealt with and staff are dismissive and unsympathetic. "
"Involvement","Stop taking advantage of people's vulnerablity ask them for there input to the care plan"
"Care/ Treatment","The medicines could be improved particularly Ami Sillpiride. The problem is that one does not feel at all sexual and when one drinks alcohol one gets rather bad diarrhea. I am lonely for my own people and angry."
"Communication","I didn't realise social services could be involved in my sons care. A friend told me. That would have been good help earlier from the mental health team."
"Communication","Yes tell my CPN to call me when she cannot make it her app with me as this upset me more this is not a game or she could text me but I don't hear nothing for weeks then she just turn up out of the blue, that why I not take my tablets cos she not there for me. Thank you X x PS I ring her a lot she don't get back 2 me or pick phone up."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am very depressed with the care professionals not helping me out enough finding and maintaining contact with my birth family as I am very much alone and depressed!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am hoping they can help the family."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","No appropriate personal driven support. Extremely poor management. Some staff rude and unapproachable. I have left feeling worst. Shocking level of service. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Caring staff and things to do. Service does not provide any support around mental health ."
"Care/ Treatment","Get some morals."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I was discharged without being told why and every time I had a appointment I seen a different doctor."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Care for people, offer help and support."
"Communication","Respond to texts. I have a disability that impacts my use of the phone.  Communicate. Give me written information about a care plan, how the service works etc.  DO NOT TOUCH ME.  Your individual wish to show care does not outweigh my need to not be touched, to feel safe etc.  Be on time/ text when you're on you're way. Isolated enough as it is without not being able to go out because waiting in for crisis team. Would be healthier to be able to go out."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More people like Simon.  It is so easy for medical professions to give up on people as being difficult, but it is often people like this that need the greatest amount of help."
"Communication","The explanation of my care.  I still don't understand or know what is planned for me or my options.  I am often left in the dark."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time and professional help and not pushed too far."

"Communication","To be listened to more often."
"Access to Services","The time for people who need help, only get it too late."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Five psychiatrists in five years last two appointments cancelled and no psychiatrist at all."
"Communication","Keep my GP up to date with my tablet increase and when I have had an appointment at mental health.  Keep in contact whilst waiting for appointments with me."
"Communication","I wish someone had told me the therapy works as I have resisted depot injection."
"Access to Services","Yes scrap all the cut back, bring the services back.  Its appalling and more staff need to show more empathy.  If you can't show this and it costs nothing, you shouldn't be in the service."
"Access to Services","When I desperately need my psychiatrist it can take 3 months or more to get an appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","My experience of crisis team has been very mixed.  There have been some professionals who are caring and supportive and able to offer advice.  There have been others who try to get you off the phone as quick as possible, offering lame advice such as ""have a bath"" or ""just go to bed""."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Lack of staff has caused appointments to be every 4 months, instead of every 3 months as previously."
"Access to Services","The waiting lists to be seen; I was originally told 12-14 weeks for an assessment.  I was lucky given my state of mind was given a cancellation slot, had I not had that I can honestly say I would not still be here."
"Access to Services","Only the waiting lists, but I am aware that this is out of the hands of the staff."
"Food","Maybe offer hot drinks during appointments/sessions."
"Access to Services","More sessions, more time and more support."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I need more help but they discharge before."
"Access to Services","The rest of the Mental Health Services are too slow and too late.  I am awaiting an assessment for ADHA.  There seems no service for that."
"Access to Services","Access to psychotherapy."
"Communication","Could be more information.  Suggest what to do after hours - crisis team.  Would be helpful if I had more information on care and services.  Could be mental health type group."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More advice about financial support, possible support available to me e.g. support worker."
"Access to Services","To see someone more often."
"Access to Services","I felt like I was discharged whilst still in a bad way and now waiting to be referred."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","If someone says they cannot do what is suggested i.e. go to a group, an alternative should be looked into."
"Communication","Yes, I could feel more listened to."
"Access to Services","The waiting time for therapy with a psychologist is currently up to a year, in my area - I think this is down to being short staffed.  I feel I need the therapy much sooner than that - and I would be more than willing to travel if it means I could start therapy sooner."
"Access to Services","Aftercare.  I was told to contact harmless for counselling but I don't feel stable enough to talk about things so I didn't go as I don't want to get worse from bad memories."
"Access to Services","Yes.  Open up the places like Span where people can meet.  That's why they're in police cells."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Having a permanent psychiatrist instead of locum all the time - so continuation of care and better communications between the team members."
"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes my CPN does not see me on time."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My friends and family have tried to get information about how to help with my care, but have been dismissed.  I do not seem to have the support received by friends from other areas."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, review mental health."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","My CPN was rude, inpatient and unhelpful.  When I asked for help with a referral, he denied me the support requested."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Things that could be improved are seeing my family, especially met mother."
"Care/ Treatment","Real research and trained professionals."
"Care/ Treatment","When in crisis, ask for people.  Should help and not give questions, why?"
"Care/ Treatment","To have a regular review of my medications."
"Access to Services","Sometimes, when people are really struggling it is hard to get to see someone when you really need to."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was referred to Mental Health team during crisis and was told I would have a worker but instead was sent to Mindfulness.  I needed help with a past and issues going on for 20 years depression.  Borderline Personality Disorder.  Now I am on my own trying to deal with my thoughts and feelings."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to know of others with my diagnosis in groups, etc."
"Care/ Treatment","When I was referred to a psychiatrist about 5 years ago the experience was poor.  I met her at Highbury hospital, she was disorganised and cold.  Seemed completely unprepared to deal with mental health conditions."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More support in the community.  More services available, instead of taking them away."
"Access to Services","If not in crisis, it takes a very long time to be seen.  I currently see a doctor who has been helpful, but it is very tangential when discussing health.  He could allow his patients to talk more about their circumstances.  Instead of rambling about previous experiments for up to half an hour."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When I was admitted to hospital twice before, I was discharged without any support in community.  "
"Access to Services","The waiting times for me to see a therapist is 1-1.5 years, which seems ages to wait to be seen."
"Access to Services","If appointments with psychiatrists could be extended to 30 minutes."
"Care/ Treatment","Being taken seriously and having the opportunity to be actively involved and listened to!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Once you're discharged from the psychiatrist and released back to the care of your GP, there is no longer anymore support offered, so you're on your own, still in a vulnerable state.  I have relapsed several times and no follow on support."
"Communication","Better ways to be able to contact health carer."
"Care/ Treatment","Medication.  Benefit advice.  Assisted homes, warden."
"Care/ Treatment","Staff, CPN and psychiatrist did not adhere to my advance statement.  I will be putting in a formal complaint."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, more understanding."
"Access to Services","Timeframes when waiting for further treatment.  I am awaiting distress tolerance and am unable to have counselling (which I could do with) because I moved from primary to secondary.  I have been without a counsellor for too long."
"Care/ Treatment","Crisis team need to show more compassion and understanding of various mental health problems."
"Access to Services","Waiting time for appointments - I have waited from February 2016 and have got an appointment for July 2017."
"Access to Services","The length of time between psychiatrists appointments.  Due to change of consultant, I had to go for 6 months, instead of the usual 3."
"Access to Services","It's difficult to get counselling or activities.  In a recent time of multi-crisis there was no NHS counselling available.  I resorted to a charity which my sister saw advertised in a bank."
"Communication","That staff actually listen to what you have to say and not make assumptions.  Not to be penalised or made to feel uncomfortable if you don't take medication you don't agree you need."
"Care/ Treatment","Appointments not being made when told they would be."
"Access to Services","Waiting lists, waiting times for appointments, contact with patients, clarity of thresholds, smoother transition between children and adult services, explaining future plans for treatment."
"Communication","Talking to my wife when she phones crisis team.  They always say it has to be me.  They say she will need to go through police if anything happens."
"Care/ Treatment","I am looking to request a change in my psychiatrist as I feel he and I aren't in agreement regarding my health, wellbeing and medications.  I hope to transfer to a new/different psychiatrist this year, one who listens, understands and takes my wants and needs into consideration, rather than just prescribing and increasing medications that evidently have displayed no real improvement.  Being given a CPN would be good.  Waiting lists for groups - support and talking therapies are too long."
"Communication","Yes - writing letters to GPs, new care plans etc. were very slow."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More hands on support physically."
"Care/ Treatment","I think therapists should be careful for any single customer which a wide range of options including and the most important, offering workshop of therapies that change people's mind set and how they react to life events."
"Access to Services","Yes - I wanted to be in contact with a psychiatrist for longer, not seen one."
"Access to Services","I have waited a long time for CBT, after being under CAMHS since age 11.  I am getting the correct treatment, however , it should have been given earlier."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, I haven't had any information on my condition and it sounds like there isn't help out there for depersonalisation/derealisation.  I don't know much about it or why it can just start.  I feel I will never get better if there isn't help for it.  Firstly I was wrongly diagnosed so went through one year of hell, never mind got given the correct medication.  I felt let down by the NHS and that I wasn't being listened to."
"Care/ Treatment","My dosage of one of my tablets, I think I need reviewing because I feel they do not do as much for me as when I first started taking them."
"Access to Services","Waiting times.  I am between counsellors."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Feel like I've been passed around from one service to another due to lack of funding - like I'm expected to get better overnight."
"Communication","The Basil Healthy Advisories need to be mentioned.  I needed to get things off my chest which I couldn't due to not given appointments."
"Care/ Treatment","A lot of my care in NHS mental health services has been too controlling and focussed on medical model."
"Care/ Treatment","Having to phone your GP early in the morning doesn't work for me as if you don't get an appointment that day, you have to call the next day in the morning.  I don't really get up sometimes early in the morning for 8:30 am to make your appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes - help me please."
"Communication","They don't listen and assume they know what's best and I don't have a say.  If I disagree they won't treat me and I'm back to square one.  I sometimes feel I have to be better before they will help."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Keep it up."
"Care/ Treatment","After the age of 65 nobody cares, it seems to me."
"Access to Services","I need help now."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Speed of knowing how far up in receiving more one to one."
"Access to Services","The initial access to the services is painful to navigate and takes far too long."
"Access to Services","More access in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire."
"Access to Services","The waiting list time was far too long and I had to pay for private therapy whilst waiting to start."
"Access to Services","I would like to be able to access psychological therapies but have been told there is not enough funding and that the waiting lists would be very long as well."
"Access to Services","I have more than one mental health problem and unfortunately due to restrictions on the number of sessions available I will leave therapy still suffering.  The waiting list time is atrocious and there is no support for people whilst on the waiting list."
"Access to Services","Waiting times are too long, crisis end up leaving due to only being short term help, meaning you're left unsupported and then forgotten about, which adds to the distress of being in need of crisis help and feeling worthless for not being able to cope with living."
"Involvement","I would like to know what my care plan and feedback on my progress or my failure."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Don't refer someone for cognitive behaviour therapy when they have explicitly said CBT does not work - have other options available and GP to support referrals more.  Mental Health to check emails."
"Access to Services","I would like access to a psychiatric nurse if possible."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","We need a long term consultant psychiatrist at the Rushcliffe mental health team.  We have had a series of locums now for some considerable time.  A long term one would be greatly appreciated by many patients to ensure a better continuity of care."
"Care/ Treatment","Possibly a bit longer.  I.e. more than a hour."
"Communication","Manor Road - they never seem to pass messages on.  Plus, my old CPN never returned my calls, even when I was desperate."
"Care/ Treatment","Regularity of appointments is heavily disrupted by national holidays and staff vacations.  I would rather see anyone than no one."
"Access to Services","Seeing psychiatrist more often.  I saw one in August then got the appointment for February, which was then cancelled to June with no explanation."
"Access to Services","Took too long to get there and diagnosed.  When I first got help I was bombarded by about 8 different people and it made my anxiety worse and my concentration too much at once."
"Access to Services","Waiting time."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel that the crisis care is excellent.  However, I feel that people who aren't in crisis are sort of not really paid attention to.  If they were, I think more issues could be prevented, saving the NHS in the long run."
"Care/ Treatment","The care I have received from MH services has improved dramatically over the last few years.  This questionnaire would have displayed a very different result before 2013 and even worse 10 years ago."
"Communication","Phone contact with therapist and clinical therapy centre.  GP surgery listen to patients and staff not being judgemental towards the patient.  Need with contacting crisis team but not given correct information."
"Access to Services","I only had a few sessions - my psychotherapist has been off sick for a number of months."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I think she is stretched too much.  I would like more time but understand how busy she is."
"Communication","My step four counsellor changed from being quite helpful, when day location changed, she began to talk about herself and I found it difficult and not helpful.  I need someone who has fully recovered, if has a mental illness, I understand that.  People are going into mental health, not to help other people but to help themselves."
"Access to Services","After having a relapse with my mental health and seeing my GP, being able to access services took months and seemed to waste time on assessment appointment and group meetings.  Also had to first go through the Lets Talk system, only to be told my problems are too complex and chronic, I feel this delay made my symptoms worse.  It is not a waste of time and money doing it this way?"
"Communication","A contact point number that can be accessed for help when feeling really low and need to talk."
"Access to Services","Appointment times - waited too long for initial appointment."
"Access to Services","More day centres."
"Care/ Treatment","More help with physical issues related to medication."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Crisis team - useless jump to unnecessary conclusions."
"Access to Services","I am worried that if my condition deteriorates markedly (as it has in the past), there will no longer be a bed available for my inpatient care, due to funding cuts/bed number reductions.  I have needed inpatient treatment in the past."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Stop changing my psychotherapist, give me more time with them.  Reassess my diagnosis.  Listen to me, I'm not stupid."
"Communication","Yes, more information so that one can have a fair choice.  Confident identity."
"Access to Services","The lack of funding for mental health care is appalling.  All of the therapies I've had were limited to a certain amount of sessions, which was counter-productive and being told I could be referred back to them via my GP was farcical.  On each occasion I was told it was due to long waiting lists and lack of funding.  Any progress I made was short-lived as I need long term help."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Need some kind of work suited for me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was told that I need CBT but not in the right place in my personal life.  I have been discharged and no mention of CBT."
"Care/ Treatment","Perhaps not demanding support workers are client time/number target orientated.  Setting time targets and number of clients for day/week is counter productive for the support workers - too much press and the clients."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Occupational support relating to health needs."
"Communication","The needs of me were not listened to and for that reason I have been having to try and find my own support as they can't help me."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff retention is very poor, the key factor in Mental Health Services in the people; interactions, support etc. and the relationship and trust is key to working through problems and illness, yet the staff all tell the same story - of stress, poor management, overworked, overstretched and lack of organisation and great people are leaving due to lack of resources."
"Care/ Treatment","I found it uncomfortable that a lone male was sent to my house when I live on my own.  Fortunately a friend agreed to be in the house.  After this of course I recognised him."
"Access to Services","Waiting a long time for an appointment."
"Access to Services","When I was discharged from the crisis team in 2016 I felt nothing but abandoned.  Left out to dry to defend myself.  I feel unworthy to anyone."
"Care/ Treatment","There are times when I don't feel properly understood."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My brother on the other hand, gets nowhere near the care he needs."
"Care/ Treatment","Left to own devises, feel cut off when services end.  Then have to wait before I see somebody."
"Care/ Treatment","My appointments are useful but too short and too far apart.  I feel that the help I have been needing is not available in my area, therefore I have not been getting it at all and therefore have long term needs not addressed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not been the same since Emmanuel left - he was brilliant understanding deaf issues."
"Access to Services","You get the help needed eventually, as the waiting times are so long as the resources are so stretched.  There is not a lot of support offered whilst waiting to use a service or to see someone about your problems."
"Care/ Treatment","the care I receive at the moment suits my needs and doesn't improve my life or my mental well being at all.  I don't have any mental problems at all, I experience extreme difficulties and hardships in my life, if this problem could be solved I will be happier."
"Access to Services","I keep asking for mental health support, but just keep hitting a brick wall.  They don't seem to take me seriously."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would like more one to one as the group therapy wasn't to my needs."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was getting help to get to hospital but they have stopped helping and supporting me getting to the hospital.  I am disabled, need more support."
"Access to Services"," I was referred for cognitive behaviour therapy, currently on waiting list for psychotherapy.  I had anxiety around this.  The guy I saw listened but I felt I wasn't heard.  I was told my eating disorder wasn't existent (after a 15 years problem), and I just needed to diet.  Felt it very insensitive and he admitted my needs were too complex."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I saw an SHO for my initial appointment.  I was then referred to different service.  I have a second appointment (follow up).  Bet I don't see the SHO that I saw first.  This means I will have to go through everything again."
"Access to Services","New psychiatrist appears to really listen however, I do not see her often enough."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","lack off informed choice."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Every patient is different.  I was and have been made to feel like because others are worse than me, that my illness doesn't impact my life that badly, but to me it controls me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have had steroid injection in my shoulder and it has helped, but after 6 months my shoulder is really painful with limited movement.  This is why I feel I need to see a physiotherapist."
"Access to Services","Quicker referral times for people with mental health issues."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am in the middle of complaining about my care with NCC complaints department.  On going for six months!"
"Communication","Find it hard to put things into words so they know little about my home life."
"Access to Services","How many people slip through the net due to having to wait when their mental health has deteriorated.  I am still waiting for a referral for additional therapy due to understaffing and funding cuts."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It would be very helpful if they give more time until you'll be treated."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I would be dead if it wasn't for my family supporting me.  The services aren't there."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Staff have reduced in Rushcliffe.  Not replaced the level of skills and experience, with an unusual disorder I no longer have someone in the team who fully understands me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was discharged for not attending an appointment for a course that I did not receive an appointment for!"
"Access to Services","Crisis team too hard to contact.  Have got to go to QMC, too noisy, overwhelming."
"Care/ Treatment","For my medication to not have had to be changed in the first place."
"Access to Services","There are very long waiting times for any support.  I have been waiting well over a year now."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have been on medication for over 26 years, no other offer of help - I have hair loss, not right."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My psychical pains, chest pains, breathing problems and dizzy spells were not treated at or in hospital and at my previous GP."
"Care/ Treatment","My psychiatrist is good but my appointments are too short and too few to be helpful in the long term."
"Communication","Should try to call back.  I'll put phone down and look if I am ok."
"Access to Services","I was struggling so I phoned to get a earlier appointment with my psychiatrist, but couldn't.  They told me to phone the crisis team.  They told me to see my GP."
"Care/ Treatment","Generally NHS Mental Health Services are excellent, but unfortunately my one experience of meeting a psychiatrist was abysmal."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Stop changing my psychiatrist every few months."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More funding is needed for Mental Health Services from the government."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Nottingham has gone down hill since Mike Cooke left.  I have only seen Ruth Hawkins with volunteers for one lunchtime visit.  Poor service now with cuts."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Through people's own ignorance 'mental health' is very much still a stigma for people like me.  There is very much still a lot of work to do out there with showing people we are actually just human."
"Access to Services","I would love to have a primary mental health nurse at my GP surgery.  I feel this would improve support a lot."
"Access to Services","Venues for services are often difficult to access.  Two buses presents the user with insurmountable anxiety."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some consistency in who you see so they understand you as an individual and not just as a diagnosis.  Crisis care is appalling.  I would never access this service again no matter how desperate I get."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I had a full assessment with a doctor that was squeezed into 20 minutes.  The doctor was very nice but I have heard nothing from them since.  I have had no choice but to pay for therapy."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Three times I ended up in A&E department.  For whole family - awful, as have to wait in waiting room.  One group returned - didn't work out through lack of communication."
"Care/ Treatment","The lack of respect and care needs to be improved a lot.  After the year the perinatal team had finished with me they completely left me to cope alone."
"Care/ Treatment","Helping me to go out to places (him with me) would have been ideal.  A lot of CBT is talking but no action."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I felt let down with the mental health team.  I got more support from my GP.  I felt they abandoned me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not seen anyone in a while, feel down, no support."
"Communication","The NHS website is never mentioned by any staff.`"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Whispering is rude by NHS staff and I was given half the usual benefits for 12 years."
"Care/ Treatment","I recognise that people have good intentions but that isn't enough."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like access to activities e.g. swimming.  Can I get financial help with this?"
"Care/ Treatment","Meeting places for people would really help, but most have been stopped due to cuts."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Connectivity of different elements of the NHS is poor."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I'm a bit confused as who I will see.  Plus, last time I had to see them at a different place.  I don't know if I get to see anyone again, because nothing was said."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I also had to have confidence to challenge the therapeutic course I was originally told I would receive.  if I hadn't challenged it I would have received the same type of therapeutic techniques used before that didn't work.  It needs to be collaborative from the start.  During waiting list time it would be therapeutic to have contact with them on the list and some kind of support.  This questionnaire is too short for a full reply on this matter."
"Access to Services","Needed help 22.03.2017, rang crisis to be told I'm no longer open to crisis team, been passed to recovery without being informed of decision.  Crisis had told me that I was being supported by them until I got a CPN, I haven't got a CPN and I am in total crisis without support.  Not had any contact from recovery group, so I am totally alone and feeling suicidal all the more now.  Feel like no one to turn to now, needed help but been let down, been told someone will call tomorrow to discharge from crisis so ignore all my calls for help.  So I'm left to struggle alone today, unsafe and scared."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would benefit from see the same doctor when I attend clinic.  Each time is a different doctor."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I was in Millbrook over four years ago and their was a member of staff who was not very nice."
"Care/ Treatment","Experienced sexual dysfunction due to medication?  Would like doctor to consider these side effects."
"Access to Services","Due to the months gap I had because of Christmas and annual leave I went back to a private counsellor whilst waiting for my clinical psychologist appointment."
"Access to Services","So that's 10 months before I see my psychiatrist and I am also my husbands carer who suffers with bipolar disorder."
"Care/ Treatment","I have too many complex issues, so I looked up stuff myself then asked for the right help."
"Access to Services","I have needed to see my GP for medication since my psychotherapy has been put on hold."
"Access to Services","My referral from GP was refused because I wasn't the right age!  GP personally wrote a referral request.  This made me feel that I wasn't able to get support.  Thanks to a change in my meds I was able to improve."
"Access to Services","Waiting for essential therapy (MBCT) is far too long, I've had to do therapy on my own!"
"Care/ Treatment","No, I would rather have a face to face for confidentiality sake to avoid stigma."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Carer for a mentally ill person should be given more support."
"Access to Services","I am not sure how much support I would have received had it not been for my sister phoning my GP.  Once the process was set in motion it worked well."
"Access to Services","Follow up on the assessment phone interview. Apparently a 4-8wk wait is actually 12+ and I have to chase your service."
"Access to Services","I needed more time and support to put into practice my new found skills and techniques."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Mental health-care of people diagnosed with schizophrenia are in a lamentably sorry state, with atypical anti-psychotics causational in life-threatening physical ill-health, instrumental in the data showing premature death some 20 years prematurely - namely weight-gain and obesity and leading to chronic, terminal diabetes, which psychiatrists eagerly side-step and take evasive lack of responsibility for."
"Care/ Treatment","Better organisation. Not be rude and patronising and a better patient experience. Inform patients what will happen next rather than keep them in the loop. Very poor experience from X X and phone staff are very slack and offer poor call handling service."
"Care/ Treatment","You could avoid keeping abducted staff nurses in your ward and forcing them to take medication. You could adhere to NMC code of ethics and not threaten with depot if an abducted human exercises her rights. You could learn that home is a safer place for a human than an institution.  You could learn that going private means you have nothing to do with the NHS. You could learn that if a private patient finds herself in an NHS institution AGAINST her will, she has been abducted. You could teach your nurses to address patients the way they want. You could learn human rights and fairness. You could treat an abducted staff nurse with dignity and respect. You should treat your patients as individuals. You should avoid using one liners against patients. You could learn that not all sections are legal. You could learn that ones husband knows his wife is healthy mentally and does not require hospitalisation or medication. You could teach your staff not to threaten to take ones phone away. You could teach your staff not to intimidate patients. You could teach your staff to stop running about when nothing is happening. You could teach your staff to know that home is safer for a home adult. You could question the police when they bring patients in, and ask to see the police report. You could prove your innocence in my abduction into your ward."
"Access to Services","Help as supposed to."
"Access to Services","Have more availability for appointments. The only negative thing was that my therapist was so very busy she had to cancel and rearrange some appointments."
"Care/ Treatment","Feel as though the care is not ongoing or monitored e.g. once you started on a course of tablets, after a time you're on your own. For months or years until it gets so bad that your calling crisis or having multiple appointments with your GP."
"Access to Services","Follow up, even a phone call? Had distress tolerance, eleven weeks, then nothing. Liaise more with general practitioner regarding medications."
"Access to Services","Yes, the time it took when discharged from the crisis team to see a community psychiatric nurse at clinic, not home."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have been seeing a junior doctor since moving to Nottinghamshire county. Despite having complex needs my mental health has further deteriorated, as a result and I have no therapy."
"Access to Services","Any scheduling has been really hard.  All people have individually tried."
"Access to Services","I see the same consultant psychiatrist every time. His problem is that he is short of appointments. Between appointments I had a crisis and called the team. They said 'call back tomorrow if no better'. Later that day GP called the crisis team, but still no response. I felt extremely ill."
"Communication","I wasn't listened to in my latest assessment to determine the care I needed. I was given no appropriate treatment and basically shown the door."
"Access to Services","The individual clinicians are . . . . clearly frustrated with the state of mental health provisions."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Nothing special. Ordinary, like others."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There is only so much they can do when they work and work, and operate under such an outdated and limited consultant. The quality of care suffers."
"Communication","It has been a nightmare for past fourteen months. Virtually no information when I rang to ask about potential care following retirement of consultant. Until then, I had a wonderful consultant psychiatrist for more than 30 years until his retirement. Also had an excellent consultant for previous eighteen years. Was seen regularly, which was major support and perfect."
"Access to Services","No, I'm struggling. I'm referred at recovery and I can"
"Access to Services","I have no ongoing mental health care."
"Access to Services","I am receiving no care."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","After seeing doctors <Nov 16>, who told me my attempted suicide was down to grief, was totally wrong. That's why I've attempted suicide several times since then, that the police was called each time."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I can't comment due to the fact that I do not want to revisit the trauma that I endured while being hospitalised and the desperate measures to ensure my mental health would be cared for by such mental health carers."
"Access to Services","No, I don't get none, I feel let down."
"Communication","Not really. I feel that I never really got a chance to talk. He did most of the talking, at one point he told me that I was unsure about what I wanted to do?  And about treatment which [words unreadable]."
"Care/ Treatment","Initially yes. Now it seems just a review of how well the prescribed drug is stabilising the condition."
"Access to Services","...  lack of service ..."
"Care/ Treatment","I didn't know other people there. Therapy focused on methods and tools to support impact of mental health. Everyone felt safe and was discouraged from discussing personnel issue. Why were we there?"
"Access to Services","Need and needed more support when you're back in the community. More therapies."
"Environment/Facilities","Psychiatrists office hard to find by road."
"Access to Services","I have been waiting for over two years for distress tolerance and I am still waiting."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I've seen someone different each time and one chap didn't even make notes so the next doctor was even less in the know. Initially told that 2-3 months appointment would be the norm - eight months in what [words unreadable]."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not since you deprived me of CPN service due to staff shortages."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Mental health services let me down, but my GP was there to fully support me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Very poor. I feel like a criminal or second-class citizen."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Adult Mental Health Services have made me feel very isolated and trapped during a crisis."
"Access to Services","Have been waiting and requesting mental health care and support for many years and is still non-existent. After my regular GP retired I was told a different GP not to make any more appointments, unless it was a new symptom."
"Communication","Lack of communication and appointments with my consultant."
"Access to Services","Very long wait to see inappropriate service. Still waiting for an appointment to be assessed, told couple of weeks, now three months."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Appalling service all round. Not even sure if any service exists. I was just abandoned."
"Care/ Treatment","It would be great if NHS provided a psych that knows how to apply the dry needling as it is the only treatment that is working well for my recovery."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some members of the crisis team were better than others.  Would of been better to see the same one, but know this wasn't possible."
"Access to Services","Fairly good service from GP if I can get an appointment.  Had good psychological support, but longer than twelve months."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","No, too much passing between GP and mental health team when depression kicks in, despite being at high risk before and being hospitalised in mother and baby unit.  Too much reluctance from NHS for me to go private, yet nothing forthcoming."
"Care/ Treatment","When there are changes in the structure of services and changes in staff, you can get left with no continued care and no one following it up.  It can be stressful trying to get support in place."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - None!"
"Care/ Treatment","Not everyone fits the mould of see GP see psychiatrist once, then get referred back to GP to continue care.  I feel I consistently need to push to get the care/help I need which is hard with mental health issues."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","other than the one improvement.  Shame the Tories and Jeremy Hunt don't fund the NHS properly."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More advice on any help and advice on what I can claim for.  Other help and advice, such as groups, events, meetings etc."
"Care/ Treatment","Root cause of problems should be main aim to find out about patients, not just symptoms."
"Access to Services","Don't want to lose them."
"Communication","I don't really know what is happening.  Waiting to alter medicine, as GP can't prescribe.  Lack of communication between psychiatrist and psychologist."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The service has gone downhill a lot and I am quite isolated with such little support or care from the NHS."
"Access to Services","Diagnosed with PSTD last year (May) still waiting for counselling - told six months wait.  Poor interaction between GP and NHS services."
"Access to Services","In-home support would be good when needed."
"Care/ Treatment","There has never been anyone I see, when being sectioned."
"Access to Services","Getting to see professional people quicker would be good.  I understand that there isn't enough on the NHS and waiting lists are too long.  For some people, this could be too late!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I may have done this all wrong because I do not understand what is NHS or not.  I have been referred all over, called by call centre.  I do not know exactly, precisely how it all fits together, sorry."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No point!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Throughout my life doctors and nurses have blamed severe depression for pain, assumed irrational reactions and been critical of medication.  Life is a constant fight.  I now have multiple system atrophy, a progressive neurological condition, which is terminal.  I see professionals who have never heard of it, so I am denied care.  I am done with the NHS."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","NHS needs more money, especially in mental health.  All political parties should sit down and have a grown up conversation instead of using the NHS for their own gain."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I will never try to access NHS mental health services again.  After over 30 years of mental health illness and being pushed from pillar to post I am utterly defeated!"
"Access to Services","I have asked for psychotherapist referral about five years ago, to no avail!"
"Communication","I am looking for more than pharmaceutical treatment.  But my counsellor only tells me what he thinks I feel instead of listening.  No help.  I want to die."
"Care/ Treatment","Mental health is overlooked.  We need more on-board support.  Psychiatrists in particular just see us patients as a 'job' there is no care there."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","You should employ more therapists, but I notice you keep cutting back on adult mental health funding."
"Access to Services","Sometimes it is difficult and I would like to see someone more often, such as psychiatrist, psychologist etc."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I need a lot more support because my physical health affects my mental health."
"Communication","Would like to find out about other treatments."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Anxiety and depression is very isolating and impacts so much of normality in life."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff going long-term sick, not returning.  I need a crisis number for emergencies.  Need CPN.  Need current care plan, don't have one."
"Communication","Communication between the service, CAT and AMH and service user could have been a lot better!  I know for a fact that my story is not uncommon.  I am fortunate enough to have means to fund my private healthcare, without which, I would undoubtedly be dead."
"Access to Services","Haven't seen anything for months and don't know what's happening with any care."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My partner was never offered any support."
"Access to Services","I have several mental health issues, I have requested to have more frequent appointments but have been refused.  I'm left feeling very alone in my care, with no help to guide me to a better structure involving my mental health.  My GP only wishes that there are more options [word unreadable] they themselves wish they could help."
"Care/ Treatment","I know when I am very low, I would like to be admitted even if only for a couple of days to stop me doing anything to harm myself."
"Care/ Treatment","I am expected to arrange my own therapist and this is difficult.  I have been offered no support with this."
"Care/ Treatment","All very rushed.  I'm now back to where I started."
"Communication","Complaints consistently ignored/not take seriously."
"Care/ Treatment","People need to be consulted before drastic measures are taken, such as being taken to hospital against their will."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More money needs to go into mental health services generally.  I struggle because it's underfunded for the amount of people who need help with mental health problems and severe illness."
"Care/ Treatment","It would be great if the mental healthcare team could work or help people to overcome overeating disorders.  I have noticed you only help with anorexia people or the ones who only have disorders of not eating."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Medication taken has side effects of not being able to have children.  Over last 'X' years do not feel there was ever support to understand what other options were available to me in terms of medication and support and decision to start a family, e.g. pregnancy mental health support.  I appreciate everyone's situation is different and resources are stretched."
"Communication","I've had two assessments and no care or contact.  'I'm just another number'."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I saw someone twice about my mental health and both times I felt like it was a waste of time.  They didn't want to help me.  It's not for the fact that I haven't tried to get the help but I feel like I'm going round in circles."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Matthew's benefits are slowly being cut by stealth and we have no means of knowing how to appeal.  Some advice on this would be helpful."
"Access to Services","Why can I not see a lady psychiatrist?"
"Involvement","I believe my son should have been involved in a couple of sessions to help him to understand."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","There is a huge gap between the governments claims about mental health provision suppressed exhaustion and reality.  The current gout seems to be running down the entire NHS and chronically [words unreadable]."
"Care/ Treatment","I have felt like a human guinea pig with multiple misdiagnosis of mental health condition, numerous medication changes and still have yet to find ways of managing.  Has to be easier/quicker, more fluid."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When I didn't want to see him no more, I didn't know who I could talk to, to see, or if there was the option of seeing a different psychologist.  I didn't want to talk to him anymore.  I think I knew more aches and pains than he knew about me!  A bad experience for me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have worked on mental health wards, however my experience of community services is that they are over stretched and people slip through the net."
"Access to Services","A CPN or community worker other than crisis team in addition to psychiatrist would be very useful.  It has never been offered, I usually refuse crisis team as they send a different person every visit or phone call."
"Care/ Treatment","Five appointments, three junior doctors.  Each chance 30-45 minutes of appointments is them reading somebody else's notes, asking me a few questions and cannot make any decision on what to do without seeing Doctor Nath-Genting, getting nowhere."
"Access to Services","I have tried to help myself and seek help with rape crisis services.  Disappointed and disillusioned.  Long wait to therapy, in limbo."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I would have liked support as soon as referred, at my lowest point, was suicidal and told at assessment I would have to wait a year for therapy sessions. "
"Access to Services","Waiting nearly a year for psychology then it getting cut short, due to no fault of my own, then having to reapply from the start, makes me not want to bother when I need it."
"Care/ Treatment","More long-term help is needed for people being misdiagnosed and then given six weeks of nurse clinic is pointless if no one knows what you're actually suffering with."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am not sure I have seen anyone.  If I have, I had no idea who I was talking to.  I am quite happy to talk to anyone."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am very anxious as to seeing my new doctor, Mr Priya."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - None."
"Care/ Treatment","I do not like being called a service user.  I want to be called a patient."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","QMC wards need to be better with people with mental health."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Let"
"Care/ Treatment","It would be worth considering having an area or person who can offer help in these areas which I myself, would find helpful."
"Access to Services","Had a support worker as well as a mental nurse support worker, was stopped due to cut backs two years ago."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The NHS needs to cater to mental health patients more, a lot of us feel isolated and hopeless."
"Access to Services","I have been unlucky, twice I have started treatment then my counselor has gone off sick half way through.  Still waiting for appointment (two different counselor's)."
"Care/ Treatment","The psychiatrists were mostly rigid thinking and self-righteous and some very non- understanding and verging on oppressive."
"Access to Services","CPN, only part time works on Monday, Thursday and Friday.  No social worker now, been taken off CDA with Nottingham City Council and NHS Nottinghamshire trust."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - None. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I feel that I don't feel confident in ringing crisis team due to previous bad experiences with them.  I ring Samaritans also MIND when I get suicidal thoughts.  I have attempted suicide at least six to eight times before and [words unreadable]."
"Care/ Treatment","I have found that I was left sort of alone after initial appointments and haven't got the care I needed."
"Access to Services","I wasn't offered any National Health Service therapies which I would of liked to have been."
"Care/ Treatment","More funding needs to be put into mental health services."
"Communication","I find it hard to reach out for help and without regular contact I can become withdrawn.  A system where you could text for a phone call or one on one would be beneficial."
"Care/ Treatment","I am treated like a 'bad' person."
"Access to Services","We feel a great deal of public money would have been saved (and time and energy) if I had been given mental health support years ago, instead of being ignored to the extent that my condition became so intolerable it led to suicidal attempts and A&E is worse than ever."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - None."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I've had dealings with crisis team absolutely useless.  I was in hospital and nobody had a good word about them.  Waste of time. One said to me, you will [words unreadable]."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My contact with this service made my problem worse as there is clearly no professional help available.3"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More money is needed within mental health.  I am well looked after but there is not enough funding.  It needs addressing as mental illnesses are very scary."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Mental Health Support is a joke, if people are truly helping us, talk to us, not just assume the best, after all you are playing with people's lives."
"Care/ Treatment","Over a year ago, I was discharged by my psychiatrist to the use of my general practitioner.  I realise that psychiatrists are busy people but this is not ideal as my general practitioner will not adjust prescriptions for anti-psychotics without no psychiatrist"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Support groups needed as it helps to talk."
"Care/ Treatment","Every time I have seen a new psychiatrist I have been given conflicting advice.  I don't believe anyone read my notes or knew my current medication.  I feel I am not in the loop, dread going."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am going backwards.  There is little point in life and it's getting less."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Lack of support.  Confusion, benefits, DLA and PIP, withdrawal of help from government, financial stress and anxiety.  Can't cope with form filling when stressed or using medicines."
"Communication","Safeguarding team were contacted without telling me who contacted school."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","She has been receiving treatment for many years, however still feels mentally unsettled on occasions."
"Access to Services","Once the crisis team discharged me I was left in limbo until Manor Road, but, wasn't there long before they stopped seeing me, they said they didn't have the doctors.  Not good enough."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I do not feel Nottinghamshire Healthcare provide an adequate service to me and hope to get different treatment in future.  I have more long-term conditions than the boxes allow for (different conditions)."
"Access to Services","I can no longer see the psychologist for CBT because of budgets and my appointments being stopped.  I do feel I have been left out on a bit of a limb, as talking with someone really helped me, who understood me."
"Access to Services","I was referred to for psychological therapy in September 2017 and I have heard nothing."
"Communication","Better communication between mental health team and GP and evidence of letters sent giving to service users.  If people can access private treatment don't put them off when nothing is foreseeable on NHS."
"Communication","Staff do not get back to you.  Inquiries are ignored and one male doctor was the worst experience I have ever had with the NHS and I'm medical phobic."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Both my care coordinator and psychiatrist are off on long-term sick leave at present."
"Care/ Treatment","When my previous psychiatrist went off sick, my care was just left without proper management and I had to sort out referring myself again."
"Care/ Treatment","I have not been treated badly by anyone in the NHS, however, my psychiatric doctor is too sure her diagnosis is correct.  Your professional opinion is important, but more awareness of the patient and placing more trust in them is also needed.  I feel that what matters most is recovery."
"Access to Services","waiting times to see mental health professionals.  In my experience, eighteen months."
"Access to Services","I see my psychiatrist three monthly, but it would be so good for a mental health visitor to visit me at home in between, like it used to be."
"Care/ Treatment","Transiting from CAMHS to adult services.  Crisis teams at A&E are incompetent and don't listen or even write what's happening down."
"Access to Services","Crisis team need better mobile and contact so patients like me get a response when texting to request support out of hours.  It took them over twelve hours to get back to me."
"Access to Services","Follow up appointment every three or six months."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Yes.  Just if the mental care doctors stay the same during my regular visit to hospital.  So then I don't need to explain by health or issues experience again."
"Access to Services","Kept hanging around for ages to collect my pills, probably unavoidable."
"Access to Services","The wait time for Let's Talk is far too long and six to eight sessions is not always enough.  I feel I was discharged too early because of the limit of sessions provided.  I feel majority of the psychiatrist I saw did not listen to my problems and needs for treatment."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Better support of different levels, follow through aftercare."
"Care/ Treatment","Don't change services as often.  More support for partners."
"Care/ Treatment","After having my care for a while, I feel my needs are not being met as they were."
"Care/ Treatment","Not enough to do when I was an inpatient."
"Communication","Two of the three doctors who have been involved in my care in the last twelve months did not listen, or respect my right to choose a no mediation treatment pathway.  This has proved to be the most therapeutic by far.  Doctors meet to listen to the nurses in their team.  They often know patients better."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Reduce doctors and nurses judging people in mental health crisis, when they go to A&E.  I was hallucinating, suicidal and hadn't slept for 30 hours and was covered in fresh Stanley wounds to my legs and they view us as timewasters and judge us.  An emergency is an emergency.  QMC A&E departments judge hard."
"Access to Services","More beds for crisis patients."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes funding!"
"Involvement","More input on how long you have to take and check-ups on tablets.  Not just the sound from everyone saying 'uh uh uh oh' I keep talking and who's in charge of it."
"Care/ Treatment","I would really like it if I/people could have my meds delivered to my address."
"Communication","Improve communication between service providers."
"Access to Services","I have been on the waiting list since 19/2/16.  This has been due to errors made by consultant/assessment team.  I'm still waiting!"
"Access to Services","I feel as though sometimes things take a long time to set in motion for example, psychologist waiting times.  Also would appreciate more support.  It is a very slow process in regards to any mental health help etc."
"Communication","Improved communications, if appointments were cancelled by community psychiatric nurse and once by myself.  Missed calls and messages may not have been processed."
"Care/ Treatment","Honesty."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, therapy to help me manage better.  I have BPD and only cope because my mum is very supportive."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Continuity.  I have seen five psychiatrists, explaining difficult history over and over.  diagnosis not known/changes."
"Care/ Treatment","Not really.  Just to not push me into things which doesn't happen."
"Access to Services","I have received no care in the community for about a year.  I only my psychiatrist every 3-4 months.  This is not enough."
"Care/ Treatment","The medication only supresses symptoms and does not treat the cause of the illness.  Physical conditions are considered not to effect mental health, but they do effect mental health."
"Access to Services","The waiting lists - I have been waiting one and a half years to speak to someone about the medication I am on, which, is giving bad side effects, but withdrawal so I can't come off them.  Also GP's knowledge and approach to mental health, often rude and uncompassionate and just prescribe medication without warning, support, or a plan of when/how to come off."
"Access to Services","Wait times were very long, with no communication as to what was happening."
"Access to Services","Better waiting times."
"Communication","More communication about long-term plans.  More understanding about how my condition affects me."
"Communication","Long wait for medicine to be changed.  Lack of communication between Highbury Hospital and GP.  Feelings of not being listened to properly."
"Access to Services","Waiting times for an appointment and changing the doctor is rather worrying, as we have to start again with new and I have had three new in one year."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff leave with no explanation and are replaced with locums, or not replaced at all.  No continuity."
"Access to Services","The waiting is too long."
"Care/ Treatment","Patient understanding of the care system."
"Care/ Treatment","Activities, e.g. football."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not change psychiatrist due to NHS trust changes.  Counselling not received on NHS (wanting for one year)."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Every single thing."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I had an extremely poor initial experience following my referral to mental health services, in Nottingham, as I started university.  My new doctor saw me for 30 minutes over two appointments and decided to take away my medication that I had been on for approximately eight years.  He also referred to my mediation as ""[words unreadable]"" and likened me to Lance Armstrong.  I requested referral to another practitioner as I found his conduct to be extremely unprofessional.  I believe his position is purely to attempt to stop students having access to controlled drugs.  He doesn't seem to care about the effect on their health."
"Care/ Treatment","In my opinion, it seems like labels are too quickly associated.  Medicine/tablets are too quickly a 'go to' thing to prescribe when these aren't always best."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Train receptionists not to talk down to me and treat me like I have no right to be there.  More resources, psychiatrists, psychologists.  Nurse led activities are low cost excuses.  The brain is the most important part of a human.  Treat it as such. Work to remove stigma.  Stop using mental health as a convenient place to hang your hat."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Length of appointment."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Stop changing who I am under the care of, this hasn't happened recently, but did happen frequently in the past."
"Communication","Where do I begin?  Therapists who listen!  Less tick boxes and charts.  Less blanket diagnosis and more attention to understand needs."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Yes.  Keeping the same psychiatrist and being offered longer appointments (not just every three months!)."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Psychiatrist has changed.  I see a Junior who has started as though I am just coming into mental health."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not nearly enough time to talk about how problems affect me.  Feels like a factory line sometimes."
"Access to Services","It is hard to see a psychiatrist when needed, have to wait weeks."
"Access to Services","Over a year to wait for treatment is too long and I'm aware of friends who have never been offered the range of treatments I have.  These need to be more accessible for all."
"Access to Services","Took over three months to be seen, when I was really unwell and desperate and both me and my GP really wanted me to be seen sooner."
"Care/ Treatment","The crisis team could have been more understanding at times."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I had seen my psychiatrist in twenty minute sessions, she was too busy and too late to write me even a prescription.  No time for me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Mac community support."
"Access to Services","Yes this 20th session and dump them afterwards and leave them high and dry is not good.  It should be up to the client if they want to end the therapy."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have asked for more support from a CPN, but been refused.  I have got worse since my last one discharged me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Care in the community, I felt I needed more support, maybe a buddy, friend."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","No CPN and no permanent consultant (seen three locums this year).  Perhaps more OT."
"Access to Services","Waiting lists are unacceptably long, you have to go on a waiting list to be assessed for another list!  Services are designed around diagnosis and stereotypes, and not the individual.  It feels like barriers are put in place to 'stop' you receiving help, with blame placed on the patient."
"Care/ Treatment","In order to get help that I required, following a suicide attempt, I sought help from 'clinical partners'.  I was happy to pay for this.  My GP was reluctant to prescribe the advised medications which meant I had to continue to see an NHS consultant.  This doctor was not present for my first appointment so another one was made.  I then got to see a doctor who was rude, unhelpful and told me to ' do my own research about medication' because my job gave me 'expertise'."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes."
"Access to Services","It took two years of suffering before I was seen in outpatients.  I have never seen a consultant in two years of outpatients, only junior doctors.  Had to keep explaining my situation to several people."
"Access to Services","Haven't been involved with my GP for some time."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There needs to be more than one psychiatrist to serve the Newark area.  The only treatment I can receive for my psychiatric care is from Doctor Caroline Innes.  She is a terrible doctor, offers no support, cold and reckless with her attitude.  Refuses to allow me counselling or therapy or help with my medication choices."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I've never seen the same person twice, ever."
"Access to Services","The referral system was awaiting for over a year to get onto The Step 4, and during this waiting time I had three assessments with different people."
"Access to Services","My psychiatric nurse practitioner has warned me that, because of funding cuts, my care is at risk of being transferred to my GP, against her wishes and mine.  This has added to my levels of anxiety and depression.  Funding must be increased to prevent my health, and that of others, being harmed by this degradation in levels of care."
"Access to Services","Yes.  How long it takes to see someone when you are in the middle of a crisis."
"Care/ Treatment","Medication does little to help my disorder which I have had from early teens.  Regular consultant psychiatrist was therefore vital.  I can become very unwell and feel seriously at risk sometimes.  Stability, so important.  They are very serious health conditions in my immediate family - life threatening in each case.  These are long-term; one of my children died in their 20's and my husband died three months ago - suddenly.  All my family have dangerous health issues but cope well and get on with their lives.  There has been a major even health/death roughly every seven years, over past 35 years.  It can be stressful and hard to find energy to stay positive when unwell at same time.  Feeling adrift."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","A lot, I need help with a lot and I'm not receiving, no help, just stress."
"Access to Services","I'm now out of the system with no follow-on help, treatment or support, other than medication."
"Access to Services","Access to talking therapies.  Less time between appointments.  Involved in healthcare decisions.  Concerns taken seriously."
"Care/ Treatment","Discretion."
"Care/ Treatment","Support, getting an appointment with my care leader and access to emergency medication at times of extreme need are currently not adequate enough, in my opinion.  Lack of clarity of who to go to in case of poor mental health episode, GP or particularly doctor.  Too much time pressure on mental health staff resources, appointments are often too far apart to provide support needed and appointments themselves are over rushed."
"Access to Services","Yes, waiting time for appointments far too long."
"Access to Services","I would like to see a representative in the mental health services more often."
"Communication","Recently relocated from Notts.  Have set up new GP, have not been given referral from Nottinghamshire mental health team to new area, which is disappointing.  Not always provided with all picture of options available."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Absolutely!"
"Access to Services","The waiting list time is far too long and seems forever to be seen.  This really needs addressing."
"Care/ Treatment","The duty worker service, is not very reliable."
"Communication","Communication to see how you are doing (I feel out of sight, out of mind)."
"Access to Services","xxxx used to have a care worker and feels that he would benefit from the support again."
"Access to Services","Waiting times in waiting room.  I waited two hours last time to see the doctor."
"Access to Services","The crisis team could make a follow up call to check how you're getting on after your discharge."
"Access to Services","My psychiatrist's secretary is difficult to get in contact with in between appointments with my psychiatrist and rarely phones back if I leave a message for her."
"Access to Services","The waiting time for therapy was too long."
"Communication","Consultation schedules are very tight.  Often the consultant has had no opportunity to familiarise themselves with patient history and so we start from scratch over and over again.  Any misunderstandings during consultations become written up into medical history without the patient having recourse to check that information has been understood and recorded correctly in the brief and intense phenomena of consultation.  I have discovered two major errors of misunderstanding, which are now part of medical history, in the past twelve months alone.  Thank you."
"Communication","Yes.  They need to listen to my needs and not force me to see a male psychiatrist, which I have a problem with."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Yes, it's not good that my therapist was looking at the clock/watch all through sessions."
"Communication","Although I have not moved, all the staff have changed and I was not formally told about this.  Also we have had no psychiatrist in post for at least six months and this make me nervous as I don't feel very safe and don't know who I would talk to if I became unwell."
"Access to Services","Am appalled at the huge reduction in mental health beds at QMC and generally the level of service provision is shrinking, affecting friends with bipolar very seriously."
"Care/ Treatment","Continuity of care has been unacceptable in the past twelve months, also the lack of NHS psychiatrists in the area has hindered my wellbeing, this I feel is still an ongoing problem."
"Communication","Yes, he could have listened.  He spent/wasted three months because of this, trying to treat me for something that wasn't relevant.  He really did not listen or understand me."
"Access to Services","The recovery college and other support groups for people with my condition are not being continued.  I would value these non-medicinal support groups with others who have my condition."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Psychiatrist left, have had over a year of seeing a new locum every appointment.  Not enough appointments, supposed to be seen again in 2-3 months but reality is minimum of four months.  Out of hours they tell you to phone Samaritans."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes.  A more positive effort made to ignore what the condition is and to what extent is relevant to seek out strategies/support to move forward.  Consistency.  Dealing with as few people as we necessary for greater understanding of case."
"Access to Services","More physiotherapists, counselling and services.  Advice appointments, finances support groups.  Crisis team, contact with and check with.  Valued."
"Access to Services","Evening/weekend sessions would have helped around work commitment.  Not everyone with mental health issues are unemployed or off work due to illness."
"Involvement","More information before decisions are made.  Read and discuss with me first."
"Care/ Treatment","If you need to speak to someone in the crisis team and you're under a CPN they won't speak to you and try to put you through to a CPN.  This doesn't help when you're in a crisis."
"Access to Services","Waiting time!  I have waited nearly eighteen months to get the correct help for my mental health.  This has affected my work, and personal life.  Waiting lists are too long!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Will see with new doctor."
"Access to Services","Difficult to contact crisis teams in our area, but fortunately have not needed crisis intervention for three plus years."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The high turnover of staff ruins the continuity of care."
"Access to Services","I am currently waiting for psychodynamic therapy.  The waiting list is up to twelve months.  I'm currently feeling okay, but I would have liked to have started in October, when I felt rock bottom."
"Communication","Information regarding side effects of taken medication long term."
"Care/ Treatment","To be understood and that text book answers to the things that I find difficult to process and overcome are not helpful in the slightest and only reaffirm my experiences and belief that no one understands why I feel suicidal.  Or why I act on those thoughts and to be told that by taking too many of my tablets is just my way of coping!  But I'm not coping, that's the point.  No one understands the hell I'm going through."
"Access to Services","I have been moved for my interviews with my psychiatrist to Highbury Hospital.  This is inconvenient for me as I have to get two buses.  This is to do with catchment areas.  This is inconvenient for me as I used to walk to Elmswood, in Sherwood, Nottingham to see my psychiatrist.  I want to be changed back to Elmswood for my appointment with my psychiatrist every three months."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes.  More support should be given to carers."
"Care/ Treatment","More research into my condition so that more efficient medication could be developed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More peer support workers to discuss coping strategies with."
"Care/ Treatment","Wards when you get sectioned need to treat people better."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More money from the government is always needed, to maximise working standards, because we should all be proud of our NHS."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Crisis team.  When I ring them for support, they are not very good with me and upset me."
"Access to Services","The lack of psychiatrists in my CMHT has meant since my consultant went off sick I have not had a review, or seen a doctor for seven months.  Previously I saw my consultant every six weeks.  I no longer know who is in charge of my care.  I feel constantly scared I am going to lose my support and care."
"Communication","I could have been told about my mental health service has been changed.  I had to persuade people to find out about new psychiatry venue."
"Access to Services","Yes.  I shouldn't have to wait so long for the therapy I need."
"Access to Services","I would have liked a long-term therapy as I suffer from CPTSD and sixteen sessions aren't enough, as I've experienced more than one trauma."
"Care/ Treatment","The voices in my head do not go away with the medication I take.  Then I get very angry and smash and break things doing a lot of damage.  My mum gets upset about this, thinking I may get evicted."
"Care/ Treatment","I sometimes wish I could be put in contact with other patients with similar problems as myself.  I realise the therapists have hectic jobs and the information they hear is confidential, but maybe sitting as a group and hearing how each individual copes is very beneficial, once a specific problem is identified.  I attended a few bipolar meetings and could see this worked well as a support group."
"Care/ Treatment","Next appointment to be arranged after appointment."
"Access to Services","More appointments with psychologist, CPN etc.  Flexibility to see more when mental health declines.  More access to therapies appropriate for diagnosis, only accepted for one in eight years.  More beds on wards to prevent crisis rather than getting to crisis and being sent miles away."
"Communication","They could answer the phone more often."
"Access to Services","Once you are in system it is fine, but the wait can be a little detrimental because you are anxious to seek help.  I can, except though you are not the only one in the queue and you have to take your turn."
"Access to Services","Waiting times."
"Access to Services","I have not been able to access talking therapy for over a year, if not two.  I am still 'not severely enough' affected by BPD symptoms to be allowed access to an evaluation!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It would really help to be able to see the same doctor at a reasonable frequency."
"Access to Services","Yes, I like to see them more, but you can only see them for so long, so more time."
"Access to Services","Stop discharging people against their will.  I live in fear of being discharged.  My medication hasn't been changed for a while but my condition is not stable.  If I get discharged that means all hope of recovery for me is gone."
"Care/ Treatment","My GP/doctors surgery are not quite so understanding e.g. left me until 6pm once in an emotional/depressive state, eight months pregnant."
"Access to Services","The waiting time for some of the services."
"Communication","More listening, more helping, more support and more understanding."
"Communication","More information and guidance about crisis help."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Crisis team."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I needed the help of the crisis team last year.  My family called them many times, the police called them many times for me.  They did not come out to me.  As a result of the crisis team not responding, I had to attend A&E at the QMC."
"Access to Services","From seeing my GP to the therapy starting, I had to wait fifteen months.  This is far too long.  The crisis team were unhelpful, I felt they were trying to get rid of me quickly by asking specific questions to cover themselves.  They didn't really listen to me.  I've tried to get help many times before and short six or eight week courses don't work for people with long standing conditions."
"Access to Services","All patients being cared for in the community need occupational therapy."
"Involvement","I did not receive a care plan.  There were times when I did not know what care I would receive or what was available to me (e.g. therapy)."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I saw three different people on three different visits in the last year, only the first one had read my notes, no continuity of care."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I had a CPN who visited me at home.  She wasn't very understanding and made my condition worse, completely lacked empathy and sympathy."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Better treatment due to my voices and delusions which affect my mental health."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More consistency with regular appointments and communication an understanding of symptoms and behaviour issues.  A clear concise plan after therapy I've been left on my own."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","All of it.  Why should physical health be treated any differently to mental health."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Crisis support - psychiatrist appointments more often - care coordinator to be known about."
"Access to Services","Having mental health care put in place that is consistent and appropriate to my needs, instead of being given 'one off appointments' and 'referred on' due to lack of funding and resources (we are told)."
"Communication","Prescriptions could be sent electronically to pharmacist as sometimes they arrive late in post or the pharmacy has declined it due to a mistake.  Electronic sending will save time and money for myself and the mental health department."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Doctors, some of them."
"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes I have been badly treated by other authorities and companies, they seem to be prejudiced against me, which is illegal in the eyes of the law.  They are not big enough to admit they have made an error."
"Access to Services","Waiting time for services to be implemented."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything."
"Care/ Treatment","My team are and have been split into my care team have been moved to an area I don't live in.  This means in July, my care team will completely change and this is scaring me witless.  I do not think it is acceptable that I miss out because of the area I live in."
"Access to Services","Shame really that I had to wait so long (1 year+) could have been getting better earlier and may have kept my job."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","At Bassetlaw hospital the person I see for my three monthly review changes almost every time I visit."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, every person has different needs.  Let the people who know and care for me decide on my best treatment.  Not someone sat in an office who hasn't got a clue."
"Access to Services","Waiting list times."
"Involvement","More involvement for support groups."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","My psychiatrist has been on long term sick and has now retired.  I have seen three different psychiatrists in the past year.  There has been no continuity of care."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","GP's understanding of depression, when patients are in denial."
"Care/ Treatment","The clinic I go to on Ilkeston Road has had a few issues with my medication not being there, which caused me anxiety."
"Access to Services","Expensive prescriptions, unavailable crisis 'support'.  No diagnosis/recovery plan.  Uncertainty over long-term help and support."
"Access to Services","Waiting hours for CMHT.  Crisis Team very unsupportive.  Not fully informed the risks of ECT.  I feel the Crisis Team are very unapproachable."
"Care/ Treatment","I was prepared, something to help in the meantime (literature, support groups, sessions) would have been good."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The NHS could do with more staff all round. Waiting to see a professional can lead to the illness getting worse. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","As am RMN myself I often found I felt patronised when talking to professionals.  I feel my knowledge and expertise was not taken into account and I was treated like any other non-qualified patient.  This frustrated me and led me to disengaging with services when I probably needed them the most.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Don't give/try to give medication for mental health when there is no need.  Medical evidence form [word unreadable] supports this."
"Care/ Treatment","Basically everything else.   Especially the crisis team, I was having suicidal thoughts, crying, hyperventilating and the man just spoke to me with a clinical tone collected details and told me to ring someone else the next day."
"Access to Services","Regular meeting with psychiatrist and easier access to support in crisis."
"Communication","Communication could have been better.  Crisis team and Man Road Mental Health Team didn't pass on things very good."
"Privacy and Dignity","No respect for confidentiality or privacy when attending appointments.  Difficult to get to appointments by public transport and no parking facilities.  Was discharged by psychiatrist but did not receive a letter telling me what to do in the future."
"Access to Services","After first hospitalisation in 2015 a 12 month wait for services -  Step 4 psyche allow people to go private, not based on excuse all paper work  better in house."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Your crisis support is terrible when I ring in crisis, as I am told to do.  I find it unhelpful and annoying to be told to ""take a bath"", when no other help is offered."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Less swaps in mental health teams more warning about changers."
"Involvement","Would like parents to be more involved."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Actually do something!
Best thing - Nothing."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The home visits were stopped due to cost and staff shortages. We understand this but felt this was a great shame as it kept my son more in touch with the family."
"Care/ Treatment","Concerned about the length of time patients spend in secure accommodation."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Receptionist could engage more with waiting patients. Psychiatrist could do more than record what has happened since the last appointment - offer advice so I am positive about my recovery and that I am progressing! No notice board! (Psychiatric outpatients QMC)"
"Access to Services","Speed of attention. Your service is an utter disgrace. You should be ashamed"
"Care/ Treatment","Customer service. It feels as if you simply do not care. Nobody communicates. I have had to do all of the chasing. Nobody takes accountability. There is no sense of urgency or empathy."
"Care/ Treatment","Appointments in the early evening, or Saturday, more locally so our child did not miss so much time out of school. We had to stop counselling during exam period which left us unsupported at a very difficult time."
"Care/ Treatment","Actually getting the appt, instead of turning up and last minute be told X isn't in."
"Access to Services","The transition. Just before my 18th birthday I was discharged, due to my age. I needed a few more months, this was extremely unhelpful. I am struggling with the limited support I'm now receiving. "
"Access to Services","More regular support. More patience from the staff."
"Care/ Treatment","The people who visited our home were no help at all in fact made my daughter much worse with things that were said."
"Care/ Treatment","Maybe talk to some of my CAMHS people so they understand how I'm feeling."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff as this service is so valuable. "
"Access to Services","Being able to get into contact directly with particular people when required.  Direct access to child at all times whilst in hospital."
"Care/ Treatment","Foster family communications. Be more communicative and less hurried to get off the phone post unit information as promised and be more understanding of patients who may go over alloted phone calls made and not make patients anxious if calls go over time."
"Food","Provide for dietary needs. There was a definite lack of understanding regarding being coeliac to the point where health was put at risk on numerous occasions."
"Communication","You could make the patient who needs help feel more wanted and feel comfortable actually coming in to speak with the counsellors. Also, if a patient decides to walk out because of being angry about you counsellors not listening to what they actually want to occur which they think would help them instead of you guys putting in place complete opposite ideas and meetings to what is actually needed then you should actually make an effort to ask the patient what they want and to improve and to not let the patient feel like they aren't wanted in the clinic. Especially as you have the so called risk results and if they are above average  you shouldn't just ignore the care they need and not book further meetings just because you think it's not needed because the patient hasn't opened up in the first meeting. I mean it takes a lot to trust someone so I don't understand how you expect someone to open up about so much of there mental state in 1 session. Enough of the negativity, nice people but don't seem qualified to the full potential which is needed for mental care. Also the counsellors don't listen to what you say half the time and mix up your words to what they think you're saying which leads to other counsellors being confused of the situation and what you have or haven't said."
"Access to Services","Actually offer a service that is accessible."
"Access to Services","Offer a service rather than turn us away."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More frequent meetings with my counselor - but understand this is difficult. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My son was about 11 when referred to camhs, his last appointment was cancelled due to the man having a motorcycle accident and we have never heard from them since and my son is now 20 and seriously struggling with life and  on his 3rd conviction in court.  He's had a seizure , drugs and alcohol misuse , I feel he's been massively let down by you, pediatricians, school nurses etc as I tried so hard to get help and now I'm angry as I know he should have been helped then. Most of this could have been prevented. I'm a heartbroken mum and camhs in my opinion is a total waste of tax payers money."
"Communication","Listen. Respect human rights and equality legislation. Not be abusive. Have accessible rooms."
"Access to Services","Shorten the length of time between initial assessment and first appointment, we waited 10 months."
"Access to Services","There was along wait between the initial assessment and treatment."
"Access to Services","The waiting time was really long. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time from speech therapy assessment to treatment (we had to wait 11 months)"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would get more staff that would make the service better."
"MHA","That my son was not still a patient at the Wells Road Centre after a period of 20 years. When I questioned the opening of the Wells Road centre I was told they would not have long term patients in Mapperley Hospital."
"Communication","Regular contact with CPN about the patient's progress and prognosis. Very lacking. Just the worry that a close family member is at Wells Road with all regular updates."
"Communication","Listen to the people that know me and how my autism affects me and what help I need. I waited a very long time and still have not had the help I need just two very stressful experiences. You have made it worse not better. 
Best thing = nothing. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything"
"Communication","Difficult when patient has capacity to know how much information should be given as sometimes it causes worry but appreciate she wished to know and was asking questions about  care."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Getting some support would be a start."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","He has given my husband a new outlook in life."
"Access to Services","Access to Mental Health SOP should be faster, not easy to obtain demential diagnosis via GP."
"Communication","The person who my wife sees approx every 3 months does not speak very good English. My wife is unable to understand so she is very reluctant to go."
"Access to Services","Mental health should be fully funded and included within the remit of the NHS and not treated as a separate health unit outside of the general NHS."
"Communication","I feel that the male side of my case is far less helpful.  I say with full conviction that we certainly are not on the same wave length.  On his visits he repears himself constantly and treats me as if I need an Idiot board. I may not be well but I am nobodies fool. I get very stressed before his visits and feel a wreck by the time he leaves.  Sadly I feel I am seeing the wrong counselor.  Sorry that I am not able to give a more positive feedback, but these are my feelings."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I still need help to increase my confidence and interest in things."
"Access to Services","Visits by a C.P.N. would monitor my decline and review my medication."
"Care/ Treatment","I have felt sad because if I hadn't moved, that was to make life better for my husband, I would be able to cope and I think I am a lost cause. Why, why was it necessary to advise that I will have a shorter life span now."
"Access to Services","Comebacks could be quicker, results told to me. No, still waiting. I have had no results, no help of any sort since I went for my tests, I dont know where any help is coming from."
"Access to Services","It could be speeded up."
"Communication","I would like the number of the Helpline in case as the carer for my husband someone can come and see to him. I was told it would be forwarded to us but up to now we havent received it."
"Communication","Im not very well at this time and wish for most of the time I wasnt here. No, that some of the ladies sit and listen to what I have to say and when they make another time to come the next time its at there time not mine.  And if I phone and cancel my appointment but they still come banging on the door and try to push past me at the door."
"Access to Services","Only a carer every Monday 12.30 to 3.30 pm I could do with another Thursday and friday to help."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, if people would listen to what we really need instead of cutting the facilities that we use.  Mental health patients would gain a lot from this."
"Care/ Treatment","The whole structure could do with improving from doctors appointment through to visits from CPNs and OTs etc and availability for advice to carers on services and support etc.....sadly over the last 14 months or so it has ground to a halt with ever changing staff. Try to keep hold of staff and inject stability into the department in the hope of offering better services and care for the community."
"Care/ Treatment","There were occasions that mental health workers have dismissed my neurological condition when it arose as ""attention seeking"" without reference to my notes."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The CPN change too often, person with dementia gets used to the same person as a friend."
"Access to Services","More staff who are not on 3 day week. The mental health team appear to be very underfunded and running on 3 day weeks and it was only after posting a complaint on patient opinion online and involving our local MP did we start to get a better service. This is still online and was response to and seen by over 100 people the only early response was by the speech/language team. All the above thoughts are common ones which are all shared by other carers at various meetings."
"Access to Services","A monthly telephone call would be reassuring. I accept I am on my own but occasionally it is a lovely place to be. My husband is my carer. Husbands comments. After the initial diagnosis and follow up attention and feel that they formed the opinion that I was capable of caring for Kath which I am. However as Kath gets worse I am sometimes at a loss with no one to turn to for help. I feel I am left to my own devices eg finding a carer and cleaner."
"Communication","A better explanation of why I was required to attend the day care services and how I would benefit from the experience."
"Care/ Treatment","No not very helpful. When I was asked where do I see myself in the next 12 months, and I answered ""dead"", she said she could not help me anymore and I haven't seen her since."
"Communication","The last doctor that came to see me did not know about my mental problems until I told him."
"Care/ Treatment","I am the carer of my husband and have power of attorney. [Michael] does not want to have ""sitters"" or go to ""daycare"" I am the one who needs the break?"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am not too happy in life, but I don't think the psychiatrist scan helped me as I was adopted. I would very much like to meet my natural family, as I am having to come to terms with suffering abuse as a young child when there was no where else to go!"
"Access to Services","More money. So many people would get the care i had from the people that helped my family and me get our lives back. "
"Communication","More advice for my family where to get help and support."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I'm the son which I'm POA and carer, I needs to be contacted as well, to reassured that my father don't want to be in residential home, he *** happy."
"Environment/Facilities","Transport (Arriva) could be improved."
"Access to Services","Enjoyed the dementia course at the hospital but when my 12 weeks was up had no more help or advice of any kind."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The psychiatrist I saw was very stern and intimidating. I didn't enjoy seeing her at all and felt she didn't listen to me. Very frightening at such a fragile time. "
"Care/ Treatment","Staff who have treated me have either been excellent or abysmal (to the extend written correspondence was sent to the wrong address, my son was referred to by a incorrect name)"
"Access to Services","The waiting time from being referred and actually seeing someone from the team. It took 4 weeks - when you are desperate this is a very very long time to wait."
"Care/ Treatment","I have rarely been given an appointment to the peri-natal psychiatric clinic within the time frame specified by my doctor. It is always several weeks longer. If I need to re-arrange an appointment, it can be weeks before another appointment is available."
"Access to Services","Took a while from referral to CPN for initial meeting. "
"Care/ Treatment","Being put in contact with other mums suffering post natal depression may have helped. "
"Access to Services","What care might I get from now on?"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Been left to my own devices. Had no other kind of help or been given any information of any other places I could attend."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Department is clearly very understaffed and under resourced through such a shame it is so important without doubt,"
"Care/ Treatment","I was informed I should continue to do all the physical activities that I enjoyed - desire telling the CPN I had been held by a ***/taunt I was physically unable to do them, following a traumatic birth."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes, more support in mental hospitals."
"Care/ Treatment","More regular contact/programme."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","On my first visit to City Hospital, St Francis Wood I was given a memory test.  When the person (female) had marked my answers, she asked if I drove.  When I said yes occasionally, she sneeringly told me ""well you won't be now""!  I felt like dirt the way she spoke to me.  Thankfully, I have not seen her since. "
"Access to Services","Yes - as the CPN team has now discharged me and promised a discharge letter, but not received anything.  I now have no support and my memory and abilities are getting worse.  I feel that I would benefit from medication e.g. to help me sleep.  I have no follow up appointments."
"Care/ Treatment","Told only nursing home could go to despite being very inconvenient.  Sympathetic voice from SW, but feel was really rushed about and given no alternatives."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I find the people at Heather House are quite dismissive."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I would like to know how to manage despair."
"Access to Services","I felt the initial contact with the IRIS team could have been for longer.  I felt I would have benefited from more time with them."
"Privacy and Dignity","Lack of dignity, privacy or quiet space in hospital.  Better documentation of personal items."
"Access to Services","Follow up the diagnosis."
"Access to Services","Taking too long for a decision as what the problem is."
"Communication","I would still like to talk to the Mental Health Service at my local health centre (from wife)."
"Communication","There is no communication between my CPN and family (who have power of attorney) unless the seek it out."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Psychiatrists!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Help in finding a suitable nursing home.  Help with explanations regarding FNC and its impact on other benefits."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The support could have been better to suit my needs."
"Access to Services","Would have liked to carry on seeing depression doctor."
"Communication","A map of how to get to appointments on the Highbury site would have been very helpful."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not for me personally but for others who seem to get lost in the system.  I wish it was good for everyone."
"Care/ Treatment","A phone number for over 65's.  Ongoing support - my pills were stopped and I was just left to cope."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Very little consistency with consultants.  Venue of appointments always changing."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More CPNs needed, overworked and run to a very tight program schedule.  It's not their fault."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When the Iris Team left there was no help or especially advice given to us, we felt very alone my daughter and myself.  Doctors could be little more understand with mental illness and have more patience."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Since being diagnosed with dementia over 12 months ago, 3 visits by a Memory Clinic nurse at home and then nothing."
"Care/ Treatment","More funding for local CT groups etc."
"Communication","Communication between doctors, nursing staff and social services could be improved - beds would be freed up quicker."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Sometimes it would be nice to talk, without the patient present."
"Access to Services","Need to see my psychiatrist more often."
"Communication","More information on groups that cater for my disability.  One in my area.  I was left feeling rejected as I was told I would not fit in with the group at The City Hospital."
"Access to Services","Area of 'actual treatment' of mental health seems ill thought out."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","My appointments with the consultant psychiatrist, I didn't find very helpful at all.  I felt that I was being rushed and was being a nuisance to my doctor.  I didn't feel that she was really listening to me and came away from the appointment a little upset.  I felt that I was taking up her time and I felt she was quite dismissive of me.  When I was changed over to another psychiatrist, woman I've seen once, he seems a little better and listens more to what I has to say.  I do feel though that the length of time between appointments is another doctor (not seen them for 3/4 months), especially as my counsellor are now move or less over."
"Access to Services","The time it has taken to get to this point."
"Access to Services","Please fund Admiral nurses again.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think the NHS should be helped both financially and have more staff to understand the situation. "
"Access to Services","1 visit a week, cannot contact them Saturday's/Sunday's."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My wife is now in a nursing home.  The intermediate stage from needing no assistance to moving into a nursing home could be improved with greater support offered faster. This potentially would have delayed the move into the nursing home and avoided at least one of the two hospitalizations that occurred last year."
"Access to Services","The waiting time shortened to join various support groups."
"Access to Services","Seeing a doctor."
"Access to Services","I could see my CPN more during the week."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes - from being diagnosed you are left with no contact at all, you are left and feel alone."
"Communication","Social worker in hospital did not attend pre-arranged meeting with carer.  Sent to an assessment centre not suitable for severe dementia."
"Access to Services","thought when my mum said she did not want support, discharge and now, I her daughter has all the responsibility."
"Access to Services","We had an Admiral nurse who was extremely helpful, but now the funding has been stopped and we really miss being able to turn to her to cope."
"Care/ Treatment","I was assaulted in Millbrook Hospital by other patients, made a verbal complaint and made written complaint.  Was told in writing, there was nothing done."
"Access to Services","As I have language barrier, if there is a Chinese speaking care supporting would be much better."
"Access to Services","Care has been useful - not always there though!"
"Care/ Treatment","After at least 20 years of taking Lithium, I was referred to a renal clinic and found I have stage 4 kidney disease.  I feel that the GP could have referred me 4-8 years earlier.  He did not take into account other factors in my release from years of near suicidal depression in personal details such as divorce and independence after that due to my ex-husband buying me a flat and dying in 2008.  He was in a hurry to take me off Lithium and this led to me stopping it myself and confrontation with police over hospital admission for two and a half months last winter.  I have complied with the Lithium substitute, Epilim, for nearly a year now and the improvement I look for is regaining my revoked driving licence which expired August late year (It was renewed three yearly I think).  My psychiatrist (old age consultant) says I am currently in remission and last week agreed to a reduction of Olanzapine from 2.5mg from 5mg, also at night.  The CPN (I have yet to find out when I next see her) says she will phone DVLA on my behalf (with me there of course) and will bring blood pressure and weight scales apparatus when she visits in future as they are too busy taking bloods three monthly, this still comes up on prescriptions as lithium test, attempts to remove by a phlebotomist and my GP have failed.  I'm aware Epilim affects the liver, but also that I need to take something for mood control?"
"Care/ Treatment","Despite carer having had an operation for broken elbow, gallstones and mitral valve problems, given 4 days to find a nursing home for patient."
"Care/ Treatment","I am under the doctor now but I feel that the mental health people are better with my problem."
"Communication","When CPN was allocated, it would have been appropriate to receive written continuation and had a meeting with family, me and CPN."
"Access to Services","Not sure if this form includes hospital staff or in the community.  I have had little outside help since leaving hospital, partly due to many areas and my own choice.  I have yet to see anyone on my new area."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Feels like a box-ticking exercise from CPN, didn't seem interested or concerned about welfare."
"Care/ Treatment","When medication is given for mental health issues, they should be monitored daily in a safe area, such as tramadol and mirtazapine to name two."
"Communication","I would appreciate it if you stopped sending me questionnaires!"
"Care/ Treatment","I found continuous eyes on me difficult.  The heating in rooms was always too hot.  I felt a bit ill."
"Communication","I did this questionnaire for my mother who has dementia.  She was really unsure when this came through the door, so maybe these are not such a good idea to be sending out to people with dementia."
"Access to Services","I did this questionnaire for my mother who has dementia.  She was really unsure when this came through the door, so maybe these are not such a good idea to be sending out to people with dementia."
"Communication","I wish the doctor had explained how long each appointment was for, and that I couldn't be cured."
"Communication","Would have liked more information and where to get help with things."
"Communication","There seems to be insufficient liaison between mental health and worries about physical health.  I am not depressed, yet have been involved with CBT."
"Access to Services","I am a new user to these services, but I feel that the timescale has been a little slow."
"Access to Services","Just that the GP didn't pick up where your great team left off.  I know that at present I am in a stable state, but thought maybe just one appointment to see what GP may have thought was good for me to do."
"Communication","Evening telephone calls would help, he would make you feel safe."
"Communication","All information has been given by Age Concern.  We have tried to find information but have found this complicated."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No"
"Care/ Treatment","Had no care just learning to slow down with age."
"Care/ Treatment","All dementia sufferers cannot be grouped together as needing the same care due to the age differences/mind set."
"Access to Services","Care was good when I was single, but do not see any nurses now as married."
"Access to Services","Connective Therapy Course at Highbury Hospital was good, but not long enough."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I work within child protection, social worker.  I feel that services are very insufficient for teenagers and particularly too, for the transition from child to adult services.  Nursing staff are good, but too busy.  There are not enough psychologists and psychiatrists.  Many young people are left at risk with no intervention or indeed have long delays for a full diagnosis following a crisis."
"Access to Services","The psychiatric consultant, Doctor Thomlinson, was excellent and gave real devotion and care to my husband.  Unfortunately this stopped once my husband went into a care home nine months ago."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","All care is done by my husband."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My wife provides all of my care."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some of the staff had a bad attitude and also spoke down to me, her daughter!"
"Care/ Treatment","I completed this questionnaire for my husband who is in a care home with dementia.  He was originally prescribed medication for dementia.  The mind team, but on one occasion while in hospital this medication was stopped and never restarted.  I believe that this led to a more rapid deterioration in his condition and he can no longer communicate effectively."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - nothing"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","However, I did not feel I was treated appropriately treated by the consultant psychiatrist."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I do not know where you have the idea I need help, but I can cook, clean and look after myself and my lodges who is an old school friend and I haven't asked for any help.  When I went to the doctor she was very rude to me, so I don't go anymore."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - no. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No"
"Care/ Treatment","Someone from the mental health team came to assess my mother but forgot to bring the memory test.  We are still waiting for a meeting to complete her assessment."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Can you cure me (please)?"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have early vascular dementia.  The only service I have received from NHS mental health, was a short fixed-term memory group session.  So most of this questionnaire does not apply."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More understanding of mental health issues from district nurses."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to make an appointment with my carer at Kirkby in Ashfield, to discuss matters related to my last session with her."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No "
"Care/ Treatment","Aims and outcomes not apparent.  I often left my mum in tears."
"Access to Services","Self-referral to remain an option would be preferable to going back to the GP, if/when further changes occur, needing consultation with the support teams."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","But have never actually seen the doctor (psychiatrist,) does he exist?"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - NO "
"Communication","All contact appears to be via the care home staff, which I do not like, as I am often out of the loop."
"Communication","The mental health visitor nurse listens to you, the ones in hospital who do the ward rounds - don't even have your notes, last one has someone else's!"
"Access to Services","Lack of contact with professionals would help but I know there are many more in need of care."
"Access to Services","I apologise for not replying sooner but I have been very ill (wife).  After seeing psychiatrist, rare form of dementia, have not seen anyone to do with mental health.  She recommending a day service, but they refused, Xxxx not suitable."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","You have sent three of them to my husband, he has dementia.  This is not a mental health issue, it is a disease.  No wonder the NHS is going under."
"Care/ Treatment","They should understand what I've been through with my brother"
"Communication","I did return the first form blank as requested.   But that has not worked.  Thank you."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","However, care for a younger family member is so disjointed, with lacking in follow up care or facilities and provision for the future, sadly lacking."
"Care/ Treatment","(From the daughter) I have given up work to co-ordinate all of my mother"
"Communication","Communication issues between the mental health service and GP leads to delays and misunderstandings.  The service appears less joined up than I would expect.`"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No"
"Access to Services","Had to consult private psychiatrist after 4 attempts of SSRI's/he found no sign of psychosis.  GP stopped all medication, had to go back to (No Suggestions), 3 years wasted."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Stop changes to psychiatrists every few months.  It is very distressing.  The psychiatrist should read up on the person before you meet them, not at the same time as you see them.  Keeping to the same person helps."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes.  We believe when a person has to see a doctor to be diagnosed for dementia a meeting should be arranged by the NHS for support moving forward."
"Care/ Treatment","Do checks to see if anything has changed."
"Access to Services","When in a mental health place, would have liked to have seen a doctor more often."
"Communication","I felt I wasn't given the chance to speak about how I really felt."
"Care/ Treatment","All persons to pay more to the health service, to help with the current crisis we are in, if only "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More psychologists."
"Care/ Treatment","Make sure that dementia sufferers are all different in their needs, (WADs have been whisked away from their jobs)."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Need more staff."
"Access to Services","I waited too long to be seen."
"Communication","Better communication between mental health workers, district nurses and GP's."
"Access to Services","Would like a little longer time at consultant psychiatry appointments sometimes."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","There will always be room for improvements, but these require extra financial input.  The human input is at a maximum and beyond."
"Access to Services","Yes a longer therapy course."
"Access to Services","Need to find more similar outlets."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The psychiatric nurses visited my husband occasionally but I never really felt as though he offered much help or support and we were often left feeling like that was a waste of time!"
"Access to Services","I seemed to be signed off rather suddenly."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Any help to improve mobility."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I feel that now I have been told there is no more that can be done for me from the mental health team, it makes both my wife and myself isolated.  A phone call now and again would help."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Did not always treat my mum with respect, often spoke to her in an intimidating manner."
"Access to Services","Respite care and social care please."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything."
"Communication","Care has not been very coordinated and has required lots of input from my family to get access to the services I need.  Some services closed their file on me without mentioning it and had to re-open them again quickly.  This meant someone else was assigned to my case and had to be referred again by my family.  Generally, the flow of information between some services could be improved.  Again, my family have to compensate for this."
"Communication","No advice on how to get more information as a carer.  When possible appointment for cognitive stimulation therapy assessment appointment was cancelled.  No other help offered."
"Care/ Treatment","More groups or sessions to help keep the mind more active.  "
"Access to Services","The time waiting to see a psychiatrist with a view to changing medication is unacceptable.  This system of having to see a psychiatrist once in a blue moon to get any help is not working.  We are all left in limbo to struggle."
"Communication","We would appreciate more information about help at home and who to contact in a emergency."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Help in finding out what entitlements.  Not telephone communications.  Not good on phone."
"Communication","There is almost no contact by NHS with me unless I am following up results myself."
"Communication","What/who to contact in an emergency."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My memories."
"Care/ Treatment","The finance side of getting the care in place takes a long time."
"Communication","Information given to my main carer/relative could be better."
"Care/ Treatment","Attending groups who have had same problems."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I think dementia care is dreadful, all the consultant said is that my husband had dementia.  No support pack or help given to carer, e.g. me the wife, I have had to find out what I can get in the way of support on my own, disgraceful."
"Care/ Treatment","More, frequent visits.  Six months is a long time, things can deteriorate quickly."
"Access to Services","More local places where we can meet.  I live in a village and transport is not as good as it could be."
"Access to Services","Yes, they have City Hospital (mental health department,) down, Highbury Hospital is a long way for me to travel."
"Communication","Follow up with relatives, (daughters)."
"Access to Services","I only had a consultation with a psychologist for the last 4/5 weeks of my admission.  I feel that had this been available from the start I would not have needed to stay in hospital so long."
"Access to Services","We were expecting to see a therapist.  After 5 months, haven't heard anything!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","So many different individuals/agencies involved.  It is complicated to organise and I can't keep up."
"Access to Services","Locality would be better if more local.  It was a 30 mile round trip to attend the clinic."
"Care/ Treatment","There has been no review of my medicine or condition by my GP."
"Care/ Treatment","Maybe a questionnaire instead of visits (by carers), but at least one visit every six months."
"Environment/Facilities","Mum went to a 5 week help group for dementia.  The room used for The social group is part of Parkside day services - Lings Bar Gamston, Notts.  The room was a meeting room with hard surfaces and very bad acoustics.  Mum normally manages very well with her hearing aids, but was completely unable to join in.  The classes left her feeling more alone and useless than before.  We of course mentioned this to staff, they said it was often a problem but they didn't have a 'soft' lounge area as hospitals have to be kept very clean... She is not continuing with the 7 week social group because she was to upset."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Shortage of staff always made it very hard for them but they did their best."
"Care/ Treatment","Making sure a person"
"Communication","I feel that what happened was administration confusion.  Everything was sorted in the end and I was looked after while arrangements were made for my care."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes.  NHS staff salaries."
"Communication","More listening, less bureaucracy more action towards care and more understanding of individual needs of each recovering individual person using the facility without chop and change from one worker to the next."
"Access to Services","I was in a group (group therapy) and all except me and one other user left. This led to a couple of months break followed by a completely new group. This has impacted me very badly."
"Access to Services","There was still 6 months my CRN left and that was it I had no one to turn to. (only wife) if it was not for my wife i would not be filling in this form????"
"Care/ Treatment","I believe that mental health should be diagnosed at its earliest I suffered a mental health breakdown and really needed a great deal of help initially this was in 2011 it took too long really to be picked up. I suffered quite a long time until treatment."
"Access to Services","Once you leave your appointment you are on your own - difficult applying for employment with mental health - get no support financial which makes feelings worse. "
"Access to Services","Waiting time to see someone."
"Access to Services","More local *********."
"Care/ Treatment","Trainee needs to be more confident and imply their own thoughts and ideas rather than referencing from the book. Good effort but slightly uncomfortable."
"Communication","Working with team who prescribe meds has been a real challenge. People changing, lack of notes etc has left me feeling like I am organising them."
"Access to Services","Give me access to out of hours crisis help (this ceased 6 weeks after I was referred to crisis team). Give me regular access to my therapist (at least monthly). Give me 6 weekly therapy/counselling slots to unpick and get help for the impact of being a long distance carer for my dad on my mental health."
"Access to Services","Waiting times."
"Communication","Communication within the team. I attended one appointment and the person had no idea why I was there. It turned out she was the wrong person for me to see so the appointment was a waste of time. "
"Access to Services","Longer courses of treatment eg alcoholics can always go for support. "
"Care/ Treatment","A truly appalling experience. I wish I had never contacted you. You have made my situation worse, not better. A system that doesn't care and has no compassion. How did you let it come to this? Lots of organisations are poorly funded - only the NHS hides behind that. A system of low quality and low expectations. It should be dismantled and scrapped. You have scared me."
"Access to Services","Waiting times to get to see a therapist. "
"Communication","Stop sending these forms. Try asking the government why do immigrants get help & people like me don't."
"Care/ Treatment","Think need more help health problems. "
"Environment/Facilities","The rooms are a calming colour but very plain. Adding calming pictures or flowers may help feel more like home and build confidence."
"Access to Services","I have regularly been unable to get help when I feel suicidal. I feel at risk and unsupported, especially in my caring role."
"Access to Services","I am still waiting for treatment. I am on a 12 month waiting list. "
"Access to Services","Just as you find improvement - the short courses of treatment ends and everyone reverts back. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I feel let down by the NHS - you open the wound and just left us to get on with your life, do you know how hard it is, I don't think you do."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have liked a female therapist."
"Care/ Treatment","After 12 years of suffering from panic disorder and seeing various therapists, to be assessed for a different form of treatment and told I wasn't ready was insulting and ridiculous. Now have to wait a further 6 months to see if I will be ""ready"" who assessed again. I'm crying out for help, but nobody at mental health services wants to know. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more doctors, don't keep changing them as my son got ASD/ADHD and depression, anxiety and self-harm issues!  So he doesn't cope with change. My son has been seriously ill with suicidal thoughts an he's been seen twice going on 2 yrs because the doctor issue, even went without meds because of it! If it hadn't of been for my G.P I don't think my son would be still here now. She's disgusted by it and writing to them, she even had to put him on strong sleeping pills not for under 18s but she could see the pain he was suffering inside his head! I thought CAMHS would be a safe place to help vulnerable kid's???  Come on CAMHS you can do 100% better for 1 major thing makes sure there's someone on standby for these children!  Think about them as if they're your own."

"Care/ Treatment","Provide Gym staff to get Gym up and running!"
"Care/ Treatment","To look at the problems properly and give you the right medication."
"Involvement","To be more involved."
"Care/ Treatment","My drug problem was with Subutex.  I was given methadone which has now made my drug dependency a lot worse.  It would have been better for me to be prescribed Subutex and dealt with like that."
"Involvement","The prisoner would be able to choose what treatment they were given and treated as results able to decide upon their own needs/targets/treatments (within a system where prisoners take responsibility for their own actions) within IDTS (a central issue to most) they are given very little autonomy.  Methadone should be replaced with Subutex as 1st line treatment for drug opiate, misuse.  The prison treatment seems reluctant to allow IDTS prisoners any power in deciding their own treatment."
"Care/ Treatment","If people would like to be put on medication for their wellbeing on release to help them not to get back on drugs."
"Care/ Treatment","Nothing really, only the gym and need of staff to get it up and running."
"Care/ Treatment","Medication.  What we get on the outside i.e. Zopiclone.  I can't be given it for my anxiety problems.  I think this is very bad."
"Involvement","I would have liked for the IDTS Doctor to have interacted with me more.  I wanted to discuss remaining at the level I was at, but given no option other than to reduce even though I didn't feel ready.  I was left open to the risk of self medicating."

"Communication","Communication."
"Communication","Better contact in visiting and on the phone whilst ??? And to phone and talk to patient."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Just about everything. They have made my son seriously ill and I've had no support whatsoever. They have closed ranks on me."
"Communication","The support that my family and I have received has been 2nd to none - the only thing that went wrong is that I wasn't told about the carers house, my relative told me about i.e."
"Communication","Information offered rather than had to be found. Contact made to carer by Social Worker as a courtesy to see if you are O.K. being aware of what a carer should expect."
"Involvement","To meet the psychiatrist and psychologist. I have spoken to social services on the phone only. I would like to meet them all together and talk about my son's needs and problems. Has been now 4 months."
"Communication","The notice to be given before a visit is 1 week and owing to my situation, age 91! 3 or 4 days would be more suitable. Thankyou very much."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Possibly an assigned person from the care team. Some people might feel more comfortable if they can communicate with the same person."
"Communication","Signposting to services as I had to learn the hard way and did not have any information from staff."
"Care/ Treatment","The one thing is my son X is now 18 years so now cannot visit in the family centre. It is a great shame because they could play pool - WII games like normal brothers do, but there is no in between for family visiting over 18, family room."
"Care/ Treatment","More group work - would like to learn more o.g. VOTP course & anger management (therapeutic courses). Would like deaf awareness/mental health awareness courses. Mental health awareness group brought back."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would not recommend a loony bin to no one. 
Stop certain member of staff picking on patient who don't work on XXX ward."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Higher care for people in this hospital. Don't leave your family in these people's care. My sister came out in a body bag!!! Don't care about people's safety make themselves out to be the best and care high. No chance. Make sure no family has to do this. Two hospitals failed my family. St Andrews too!!! 2 sisters dead thanks to their great care, not!!!"
"Care/ Treatment","Tell the family all problems that may arise with the patient. Even if the patient asks for confidentiality, tell the patient that power of attorney should know about court dates, publicity etc. Tell family if any private information will be disclosed to the public. Make a SMART plan to help the patient achieve certain goals. Find out the route of any problems with the patient instead of just ordering disciplinary action. "
"Communication","The named nurses should update/communicate with relatives more about their loved ones progress/regression etc.  
Making the boxing up process quicker, its sometimes takes ages! (at reception.) the paperwork.
The carers champions are not visible or know to the carers.
Provide easier means for visitors to take items to patients on day of visit eg containers/baskets on wheels."
"Communication","Carer's to be treated with respect, heart and understanding and most of all to be informed about their son/daughter or good friend,  because we are the most worriers.  Not feeling part of the team. (could be better and more efficient)"
"Communication","Make sure every carer knows about what they can expect from the beginning and who to ask for support."
"Care/ Treatment","At reception signing in should be made a lot quicker, sometimes having to take too long in reception wasting valuable visiting time!"
"Care/ Treatment","Take better care of your patients."
"Care/ Treatment","New carers who have has little interface with mental health services previously (for example, if their relative have fallen ill for the first time in adulthood) require a great deal more information to navigate through the system.  Perhaps, carer support can be fine-tuned to take this into account. 
Taking case histories "

"Access to Services","I had my daughter 6 weeks ago and we are still awaiting contact from our health visitor. As I am not silly I have been elsewhere to get her weighed by the city heath visitors but the service is appalling. We contacted the team on 20/12/18 and still no response. Understandably it's been Christmas but surely this should be a priority case. It's a good job we are not struggling with post natal depression or harming our child. Disgusting! Best thing - nothing"
"Access to Services","Maintain weigh in sessions and keep them as they are has they have already been reduced. "
"Care/ Treatment","More activities during school holidays and during term time.   Better communication about training and courses   Other means of promoting activities than Facebook   More varied activity when at events   Evening or weekend courses "

"Environment/Facilities","Parking."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Need more staff to take pressure off."
"Access to Services","Wait for appointments."
"Access to Services","Baby weigh in needs to continue. It's disgusting that from Feb there will no longer be a drop in service in east leake. I don't know of one other person from another community who hasn't had problems with contacting and communication with health visitors and they have never had a drop in!  East leake has the best service by far and I can't believe it's being stopped. Probably due to more cuts! Extremely disappointing!"

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not be here.  You choose the word care but it could easily be replaced with detention, imprisonment or punishment.  Both psychiatry and psychology are theories dictated by what you wish to believe, i.e. opinion.  No absolute reason, truth or evidence has been presented which warrants such action.  It is unethical.  And whilst you perceive yourselves the higher being it is fascism and a concentration camp.  My time is devoted to stopping a crime against humanity (as ruled by the United Nations).  You are obstructing my path and contributing to that crime against humanity."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff availability."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Better training for staff to be more sensitive to the needs of patients."
"Environment/Facilities","Get slightly bigger beds for over-weight patients.  The beds can be small and uncomfortable based on the size of the person/patient."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","For doctor to listen to what help you are asking for.  To be able to be supported at home in an environment that is more suitable than the hospital, mixing with people self harming on the ward is not doing me any good at all when I'm trying to get better."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There were some members of staff that didn't pay much attention and there were also some that would sit in the office.  It would be good if staff interacted well with the patients."

"Care/ Treatment","Nothing regarding care.  Would be nice to have wider visiting."

"Environment/Facilities","Noise levels at times."
"Food","Food. No fresh food offered, veg and meat was overcooked and looked like it has come out of a tin. Smelt awful, very un appetising. No fresh fruit juice."
"Smoking","Suggest that smokers go outside at the same time instead of going off one at a time. Reason for this is benefits. Reduces anxiety for smoker waiting in line. Time wastage is managed, more time can be spent on helping patients get well soon, e.g. do more activities."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Feeling like I was gaining something out of it. I only ever have 20-30 minutes every 2-3 months which consists of writing down my past and present but never actually achieving anything. I almost feel like I come here just to 'log on'."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would have preferred to see the same psychiatrist on more than 2 consecutive occasions."

"Care/ Treatment","The only problem with the care is not much going out the building.  Trips out of the centre are needed."
"Access to Services","For peace of mind, not only for us, but for the staff at Newlands, it would be great if we knew the service will still be available next year.  We have had no definite security about it for a few years now."
"Care/ Treatment","Playing more on the Wii."
"Access to Services","Knowing it is still going to be there next year, as at the present, we have no idea!"

"Privacy and Dignity","Personal care e.g. shaving and nail trimming!"
"Environment/Facilities","Greater attention to ensure patient's clothing was not lost. Carers should ensure hearing aids and glasses are removed at bedtime and put in a safe place. Floor around dining area needs cleaning more often. Patients need more organized activities and mental stimulation."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The carers should take more notice of what the patients are up to, sometimes there is no one in there or they are sitting in the armchairs with their feet up talking among themselves."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A vast number of nurses on different shifts mainly part-time.  I found it difficult remembering who was who.  There was a lot of photographs on wall but needed updating so I wasn't any wiser, also different agency nurses for one night only"
"Care/ Treatment","Availability of a chiropodist"
"Communication","A regular meeting with keyworkers and doctor. We did have two 'set'onferences which were attended by quite a few people. A regular time to just check how things were going would be helpful - the ward rota for staff makes if didfficult to know when people wil be around."
"Access to Services","More staff on the ground."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Difficult question! More staff to reduce work load."
"Access to Services","Make it not so long."
"Care/ Treatment","A regular time to see the consultant as far as this is possible. Small space on ward dedicated to private reading or writing I . No loud TV or visitors. More showers - 2 per ward dedicated M/F. At times the ward appeared to be overstaffed with agency carers who had little to do."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I wish that the consultant could have discharged one personally, and not have to ask the doctor myself."
"Care/ Treatment","More interaction with other patients in same position."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A caring CPN with whom I could talk to and feel safe. Not to be sent miles away from home then transferred to a dementia ward left frightened no one to talk to except wonderful staff who agreed I should never be on the ward, but had to travel till finally"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not to be treated l8ike a child."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Bearing in mind how nursing staff are always on the go, it can sometimes be very frustrating if one has a very immediate problem to sort out but cannot gain immediate access. Perhaps suggest 1 staff available as designated 'listener' (every half hour or something?)"
"Care/ Treatment","More to do regard interest."
"Safety","To not shout at me when I was in excruciating pain."
"Communication","To have been given more information on my arrival on the ward."
"Care/ Treatment","They would not come so often."
"Communication","Finding information about things that you might get if you have worked for coalboard about stair lifts, having radiators changed. Not sure only hearsay"
"Care/ Treatment","More time. More appointments."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","If the carers could be a little more mature i.e. not under 21. If when they arrive to see my mother they could tidy and help do the dishes etc. It is wonderful I know for them to give companionship. Enthusiasm is required."
"Communication","Major - to feel less isolated when with a consultant and to be listened to instead of verbal bullying. Minor - a light sensitive switch on the toilet available would be helpful to those with poor mobility etc."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would tell the doctors to come out more instead of saying get down to the hospital.  They are overworked as it is."
"Care/ Treatment","I think there could be more outside activities or some outdoor space to sit in. I understand there are safety issues about the area outside which may involve costs. Maybe you could involve the relatives or some fund raising as on a number of visits it's been very hot, it wasn't very pleasant sitting in one room for me and the patients. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","1.  More continuity of contact from a lead nurse/manager.  2.  Wider range of facilities - patients sit in same room a lot of the time."
"Access to Services","More time."
"Privacy and Dignity","It's difficult to talk in front of him."
"Environment/Facilities","A bigger waiting room at Bassetlaw Hospital Mental health department."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I was very disappointed and distressed that one incident was reported when all concerned knew that I was being hit and kicked for a long time (due to my husband's condition) As a primary 24 hr carer with no help coping with an extremely stressful condition. reporting me resulted in making my stress levels nearly unbearable. I strongly recommend the pressure put on primary care workers needs to be taken into account. Given the circumstances even my G.P was surprised that the incident was reported."

"Access to Services","Length of time between appointments."
"Environment/Facilities","Better waiting room at the Bassetlaw Hospital."
"Environment/Facilities","Waiting room for elderly mental health needs to be larger due to physical disability aids used.  Not wheelchair friendly.  Also no air in room!"
"Communication","Better communications between DIVA consultant and GP.  I took my wife to see psychiatrist at Bassetlaw Hospital.  The psychiatrist said they would ask our GP to arrange an ECG to check if she was OK to have Aricept drug 3 weeks later.  Went to GP he had not been contacted but he did the ECG the next day and passed us to the Mental Health dept at Bassetlaw.  Considering that my wife has Alzheimers it is not good enough that we will have to wait 2 months before she may get the drug.  We are both 71 years old and have paid into the NHS all our lives to be treated  far worse than immigrants"
"Access to Services","It is early in the process, but it appears to be a long wait until the clinic appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","As I live some miles away necessitating two buses taking 2 and a quarter hours, it would be helpful if occasionally appointment times could be more flexible.  It may be impossible, but if transport could be arranged by the hospital from time to time."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The sitting service could be improved by trying to send the same person when possible, people with dementia need things the same as possible."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The services for my wife were better 14 years ago - since day therapy stopped she has no service to help her."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","X is the only one that's ever been. She's been a big help. Very sorry she won't be coming again. Why?"
"Access to Services","Psychiatric department - better signposting!"
"Privacy and Dignity","Being able to visit without other patients interfering."
"Communication","More communication between staff and patient."
"Environment/Facilities","More congenial meeting areas when visitors are on the ward. The dining room is not really appropriate and had no atmosphere. Tea and coffee should be available for purchase as well."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff to ease the work load."

The Voluntary Bureau at Eastwood is cluttered / noisy /impersonal / claustrophobic - unprofessional."
"Food","Lunch."

"Care/ Treatment","Making things (cards, necklaces) like before"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Mum had help for four weeks and she had four different people looking in on her.  It would have been better with just one or two."
"Care/ Treatment","In my mum's circumstances it would have been helpful if her medication could have been changed rather than having to be referred back to the GP to do this.  Also monitoring of these changes would have been helpful."
"Access to Services","Keep it going, it is good."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The final session did not see a doctor.  Felt like I had been left without any further intervention.  Left to feel very alone."
"Access to Services","Travel times."

"Environment/Facilities","Picture games."

"Access to Services","Make it faster."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Most aspects of help and care are left to me to sort out with my own GP.  The attendance at the memory clinic has not really made any changes or opened any doors."
"Access to Services","Appointment a bit closer a 7 month wait for next appointment seems a long time."
"Care/ Treatment","Being seen more promptly. (1 hour behind)"
"Communication","From moment of diagnosis there should be a care package 'pathway' offering continuity and communication between all departments across the board. I am one of the many 'so something's' caring for my father / parents. There are many beside that have no one!"
"Communication","Only communication should be made with me (son) My mother cannot remember and gets confused. I have said this before."
"Care/ Treatment","Appointment times to be kept. Not to be kept waiting."

"Access to Services","CST group ongoing all the time."
"Access to Services","Home visits."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like groups about drawing and science things."
"Care/ Treatment","It would be helpful if the appointment could be close to the scheduled time. Dementia sufferers tend to be anxious which is not helped by a wait of an hour longer than expected."

"Access to Services","My husband is not an appliance to receive a service, however there has been 6 monthly follow up appointments in clinic.He is on - which is helping. Apart from clinic appointment and now booked for cognitive stimulation therapy, he has not and neither have I as carer had any follow up to see it we are coping."
"Access to Services","The service should be taken into the community - particularly for patients in dementia care homes where seeing several together would be an effective use of time."

"Communication","When fitted with an ??? At the mobility centre, advice."

"Access to Services","To have a bit longer in the group."
"Communication","Better communications re: the memory enhancement sessions on a Monday at Hockerton.  I have no idea what went on, what the aims and objectives were.  My husband was not able to give me feedback - I would have liked to know how to build on what they did!"
"Access to Services","To have more than 6 weeks at Orchard Unit. I just got settled and to know people then it was time for me to leave."

"Communication","Notify the patient when the home visit does not happen / will not happen because the visiting employee is off sick (Support Worker failed to show twice due to illness)"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More help with mobility."
"Communication","Information after the initial diagnosis I felt was insufficient.  It would have helped to be told at that stage that mum would receive visits from community nurses in due course.  I felt a bit 'lost' and unsure what help she would get immediately after getting the diagnosis from the doctor.  When she did get the care visits from the nurses it was excellent."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, more places to sit when visiting."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Needs more staff on the ward not agency, needs regular staff."
"Environment/Facilities","The only thing would be a better lounge area, for relatives and carers to sit with patient."
"Care/ Treatment","Getting this years flu jab was delayed and family members kept asking about this over a 6 week period. Communications about this was not too clear. Eventually we were told this was delayed due to no member of nursing staff being recently trained to do this. Eventually a doctor did give all patients on the ward the treatment."
"Privacy and Dignity","That the patient got to wear own clothes not just the one's that just happen to be at hand"

"Access to Services","More flexible visiting hours."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Keeping staff turnover to a minimum to enable patients/carers so stability in the care received."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Less hurried!"
"Access to Services","See that you do not lose the room for any follow on services."
"Access to Services","The 7 week CST programme sounds excellent. We understand that the 1 day maintenance follow up programme is compromised by the withdrawal of resources and accommodation due to cuts. This is extremely disappointing and shows lack of foresight by account directors. We hope this is looked at again."
"Care/ Treatment","Would like more input from physiotherapist."
"Access to Services","I would like to return."
"Access to Services","The waiting time between the last CST session and the follow up session needs to be reduced. Also it is very difficult for wheelchair users to get to St Francis.

"Care/ Treatment","Therapy not as drawn out."

"Communication","More male nurses. Better communication between the nursing staff re: medication and scan bookings and results."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Too few staff to deal with patients individual problems causing problems for other patients. Staff unable to provide 1 to 1. Dramatically adding to stress and problems with personal care. Improve communication to family."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff need to have better attitude towards relatives and patients. My family experienced stress from the attitude of a particular nurse / support. They would benefit from realising that the family are to be treated with respect and sensitivity. It is extremely difficult to get through on the phone. staff not organises."
"Communication","Nursing staff to communicate and lack of male staff."
"Privacy and Dignity","Keep men and women in different wards as relationships have started upsetting wife very much.  Place itself is excellent, but as I live 30 miles away with no transport have found it very stressful having to travel so far.  Not happy about property being lost e.g. false teeth."

"Communication","Having one to one communication at least once a week."
"Communication","Better communication between departments."

"Communication","General information given to relatives without having to find someone and request it."

I think I should be seen by mental health in-reach team more often."
"Care/ Treatment","To have daily 1 to 1's with staff regarding my mental health."
"Access to Services","I would change the time that it takes to get assessed by a hospital.  Because it takes too long and you don't do any work on your illness on healthcare or any reoffending work, and there should be some paid work you could do on health care, and make it more active."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","The majority of staff were very helpful to patients. However there was incident where the care I received was not satisfactory. When somebody has been ill for a week and is getting no better and asks to be booked to see a doctor, he should not be told there is nothing wrong and accused of lying. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When Nottinghamshire Health Care took over the contract at HMP Lindholme I had a very bad DVT in my leg and the care I received was very poor indeed and a formal complaint was logged!!

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, so we can do things at the weekend."
"Care/ Treatment","Staff really don't seem to understand when detoxing we don't sleep  and  send us to bed. Yet a lot of people don't want to go sit on their own. It's not fair."

"Access to Services","I submitted myself to my GP due to a severe eating disorder. The waiting list was ridiculous + I ended up having to go into private care which my parents can't really afford but had to do. Therefore the wait was too long! When I did finally see a psychologist, I found it very unhelpful."
"Access to Services","To get quicker access to detox support. Usually waiting time is a minimum of 3 months but often longer, and this has an impact on your physical and mental health. It results in more GP/Consultant appointments whilst waiting which in the long run may cost the NHS more."

"Access to Services","Would have liked another few sessions and increase from 1 and a half to 2 hours."

"Communication","If it was made a little clearer what an appointment is for."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To believe me (but I do understand due to prison)."
"Access to Services","Improved access direct to a doctor. The troiage system works very well, but on some occasions some patients need to speak directly to a doctor. The triage system slows this down. A forum or hotline for one to one contact would be helpful to some patients."
"Care/ Treatment","Recently I received my first injection for Hep B. I was told by the nurse my next appointment would be in a weeks time - date given. I was told the third injection would follow in a further two weeks. This did not happen and still waiting to have my second Hep B injection. On the same day I asked for a doctors appointment and was arranged for 11th May. Unfortunately this did not happen a;lthough entered on the computer. this appointment is still outstanding. At the Easter Bank Holiday, I was not told that medication for 7 days would not be issued on the following friday. I had to survive without no tablets, sleeping tablets and Amitriptyline over the four days of the Bank Holiday. All that should have been done was, either put a notice on the dispensery window, or the staff tell everyone. What happened was not acceptable."

"Care/ Treatment","Better organisation of repeat prescription system, at times this has failed in my experience with medicines arriving late and when I have run out. I do not knoe if this is a suitable box to suggest a lockable medicine locker, similar to the oneds on NHS wards, should be installed in each cell, the keys to be divided between healthcare and prisoners. this would prevent meds theft and may also alleviate some aspects of bullying."
"Communication","To be kept more informed about outside hospital appoinyments - I know I can't be told when it is, just to be informed I've not been forgotten about."
"Care/ Treatment","Your internal communications need improvement. I waited 6 months to finally receive my correct doseage of medicine. I feel that the elapsed time it took is unacceptable given that I made request daily for this to be dealt with."

"Communication","it would be nice to be listened to more and believed about what you say and need. And not having to wait as long as you do."

"Access to Services","Change completely the approach the Crisis team had with me at Millbrook. Because at the time I was in a bad place yet they basically undermined everything I said and spoke down to me, which if it hadn't been for the remarkable care I'm receiving from a Psychologist, I wouldn't be here now. the only downfall with the psychologist is the wait you have to see them, nearly 2 years or at least a good 18 months in my case, during which time it's been a real struggle. I have filled in this leaflet based on pain management and psychologist consultations, not my experience at crisis Unit, because if it had it would read very poor for each one of the questions."
"Care/ Treatment","That time and patience was taken with people with personality disorders. It's frustrating to feel rushed when trying to explain how you feel only to feel worse when you leave because you haven't put the point acreoss and other things have been put aside which only makes you feel more anxious and frustrated."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","I was referred to wellbeing plus to help save my housing/financial situation but they did not help me with this.

"Care/ Treatment","I would improve the way most doctors have treated me. I have not had regular M.R.I scans like I should do.

But due to me having to stay here at HMP Newhall, there is nothing else I can do about the matter."
"Access to Services","Nothing cos it's good as it is. I would say shorter waiting times for appointments to see the doctor cos you can put am app in and wait a while, but I understand that there's loads of people who are going to want and need an appointment."

More afternoon visiting hours (having no car and travelling an hour each way made the 18.30 to 20.30 difficulty by public transport. Sep seating areas for visitors. Two hours seated on a table not very comfortable for older visitors."
"Access to Services","The only thing I could say is that the initial communication regarding the family members care could have been a lot better. Information for the family especially when the patient is young is vital for all. Parents and family need to be guided and given an understanding along each step of the way which at first wasn't given, but after the initial day every step was taken to communicate and support the family. "
"Communication","The doctor who handed our son into A42 from the A and E department didn't know the protocol in the ward.

"Involvement","Freedom of choice."

"Access to Services","Cut down on the visits"
"Access to Services","Doing too much for time allowed"
"Care/ Treatment","The best years of my life have been wasted taking medication that disconnects you from others and renders you a pointless zombie.

I have not received an apology. Nothing has been said to me at all. I feel they are pretending it didn't happen. Also knives and forks very often still have food on them from not being cleaned properly. I'm sure that this is a health and safety issue."
"Access to Services","I had to wait approximately 3 months to see a psychiatrist. I feel that this was too long as I was due to a change in my medication. Luckily I had a good G.P and by the time I saw the consultant my health had much improved."
"Care/ Treatment","More Occupational Therapy support."
"Care/ Treatment","Why is it necessary to have the wretched radio blaring out in QMC psychiatric out-patients? It is intrusive  and  intensely irritating and raises my stress levels to the point where I have to leave the waiting room  and  wait elsewhere. On one occasion I have been the only person in there  and  a receptionist has put the radio on without asking me that was ok.  If we must have music in the waiting room at least supply some sort of easy listening CD  and  do not subject already stressed patients to loud pounding noise  and  the inane, mindless chatter of local radio."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","To have the same therapist or Doctor throughout. I have had 3."
"Access to Services","More frequent visits."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Psychiatrist should listen to her patients and be professional. She is rude, confrontational, arrogant.

"Care/ Treatment","Getting seen more often."

However, my request is to change the name of the St. Francis centre because of the past association this name has with regard to mental health + the stigma it has with it's past + the fear it has to old people who now come to St Francis."

"Care/ Treatment","Only if it was a bit quieter. Friends that seem so nice to all of us."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Probably this is the opinion of an old lady employed for 36 years in the NHS (Registered nurse, Children's General midwife) but it seems more ?? could be spent more on nurses badly needed and midwives and less on filling in forms. This is the second I've filled in. waiting for the good lord - asking how we think of heaven - or hell!!"
"Care/ Treatment","My mother has been in and out of hospital (B2, kings hill several times, B1) this year. She has put on a lot of weight the medication is not stabilising her 2 one type caused coronary probs. * More outside activity* More interaction from staff please."
"Leave","A chance to prove I can care for myself and create another family surrounding to live in. Life in B1 is boring. This could add to frustration. Staff talk together and don't let patients join in."
"Care/ Treatment","More one to one counselling. Temperatures in hospital so high, liable to make hardy people nesh. Body temperature enough as stated in tropical Britain people acclimatizing to tropical temperature with ridiculous central heating temperature. Feeling cold outside even in summer. More healthy diet. Fresh greens, real meats. Big 5 almost impossible to obtain. Veg should outweigh potatoes. Salads not plentiful enough, portions not large enough to maintain healthy stomach size."
"Physical Health","Home visits from dentist and optician."
"Communication","Communication between agencies and between agencies and client."
"Care/ Treatment","Care was good but patients on ward B52 need stimulation like television, music, etc."

"Care/ Treatment","Appointment flexibility"
"Care/ Treatment","Reintroduction of complementary therapies."

"Access to Services","Personally, I work so a service out of hours would suit me best. I have to take time off work to meet my appointments."
"Access to Services","Being referred quicker as this would have made my recovery from my illness quicker. I had many more months of anxiety due to my illness as it took months to see my psychologist."
"Communication","More feedback re: progress or lack of it. Understanding medication. How it affects therapy.  Alternatives - Targets."
"Access to Services","That the service be closer to home (Collingham). It seems a shame that such an excellent service is an hours drive away."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","When my therapist went off on long term sick leave I was left without a strategy in place. No one else to contact. There was no information given. I would liked someone to 'pick up' the therapy."
"Care/ Treatment","Use more of a holistic approach. The NHS is obsessed with CBT which doesn't suit  everyone, Therapists need to use a more eclectic approach, adapting to needs of the patient. My needs are very complex and CBT was inadequate to deal with the,."
"Care/ Treatment","If it is not a flexible service, how long will it last for?"
"Leave","Less restriction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              "

"Involvement","Be more involved in the decisions about my care rather than healthcare making decisions for me."
"Access to Services","I highly recommend that direct assess to a doctor is improved - I think that people who have had long term treatment in the community should still get the same level of care in prison. I think the time of doctor response from information received should be a lot quicker or as stated above direct access to combat the long time scale of action/reply."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time in a meeting. Improve the waiting time as it takes ages from posting an healthcare application to actually seeing a nurse."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More doctors as you try and appeal a decision and get nowhere."

"Access to Services","Nothing I believe it gives us more than enough. Just maybe quicker dental appointments."
"Access to Services","I have serious Arthritis and outside of prison I get good Chiropody service. In prison I have to wait many months to get appointment to get my nails cut. Since my last appointment 3 months has passed and am now told I have a further month before treatment. Long nails makes it difficult to get in to bed as I have limited movement, my long nails catch on the sheets. This problem needs resolving. Each morning I cannot put my socks on. A prisoner from a different cell comes to put my socks on. Even after 10 months and still has not been supplied. They cost ?2.70 from a hospital. Surely, this should be available in prisons? Nottingham prison healthcare was rubbish. Many of the staff need replacing. Surely unacceptable for healthcare staff."

"Care/ Treatment","To be able to see doctor without seeing nurse before and forms to explain why to see doctor like all other prisons I have been to!"
"Access to Services","I'm on IDTS and the service as well as support from the nursing staff was excellent when I arrived here. But it took over 2 months before I saw a care worker."

Not to be taken off medicine in prison when specialist have recommended you be on them Not to use methadone for a painkiller because they prisoners on painkillers.

"Care/ Treatment","More practical work."
"Care/ Treatment","It's OK for RMN's to come and see you but isn't there meant to be work done towards getting better? I feel I'm stuck in the same place with no progress being made, although I am resolving most issues myself. Work can be done without waiting for a diagnosis."

"Environment/Facilities","Not enough facilities for day care. When patients need to be doing something."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To be treated as an adult by the doctor - not just questions but sharing of his opinion. For all staff to show equal commitment to patients - the disparity in approaches was vast and the varied levels are confusing and unhelpful. Consideration should be given to the teaming on shift because often a strong shift, full of leaders is followed by a shockingly weak one (x and x). Food is an embarrassment.

"Care/ Treatment","We need a OT worker"
"Environment/Facilities","Excellent patients to keep food and drink areas and sitting room, remove dirty cups, use bins - no food ??????? (smells)??"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","I have been under the mental health team since 2001. Throughout that time I felt I was not listened to properly by the doctors I saw. The entire period seemed to consist of 10 min appointments, going over the same information. This was usually because I saw a different doctor/psychiatrist for the majority of the appointments. This system is not in the best interests of the patient, and my treatment has suffered because of it."

"Communication","More information on what areas were being discussed or have been discussed in a therapy session so that we can prepare or be prepared for resulting behaviours."
"Care/ Treatment","A better CBT therapist would could help me tackle my negative thoughts and anxieties, or to have my intensive therapist for longer so they could help me instead."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","To feel staff are less judgemental so I am able to utilise the services offered."
"Involvement","To be more involved in care plan decisions."

"Access to Services","All though I am aware of the work load, I feel that the service / input could be speedier in order to decrease the anxieties of the client and carer."
"Access to Services","The time of receiving."
"Care/ Treatment","If I could change one thing about the care I received from CAMHS, is that the doctors would have covered my medication while Dr X was on leave."
"Access to Services","Better after care."
"Access to Services","More hour"
"Access to Services","See social worker more."
"Care/ Treatment","Found it hard to come up with ideas at the start of the group for topics to cover. Room too small for the group. No tables in room so hard to do craft activities."

"Access to Services","Wish it was still going"
"Access to Services","I stayed here too long."
"Access to Services","We understand that the CAT support must come to an end. However, the support will be greatly missed.

"Leave","It would be nice if the client users could have more time out of the unit."
"Access to Services","The uncertainty about hucknall house's future causes myself (mother/carer) and my son great concern. My son has challenging behaviour and many things easily trigger problems. Staff at hucknall house know him so well and his trigger points. So to have to move elsewhere would be very damaging for X and his family."
"Communication","It is important for young persons accompanied to have a support worker with them to advocate on their behalf. To ensure this it would be good if an invitation to attend could be included in communications with the young person  and  their family."
"Communication","As a family we would have appreciated being made aware of my aunts progress as we were aware of how ill she was on admission and there was no info or update until she was ready to be discharged."
"Leave","Longer visiting hours."
"Access to Services","Reducing the bed status and amount of experienced staff on A23, had a very negative effect on my mums care. It appears that the QMC do not want MH problems at their hospital.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have appreciated a more friendly reception at Retford Hospital. I found the receptionist at the desk cold + clinical + dismissive in attitude."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Communication from doctors. I never saw the same one twice in two weeks and I always felt I had to pus to get one to come and talk to me/mum. Also saw 5 different nurses in charge of my mother - Constant change makes continuity difficult for them, me and my mother."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything great."
"Care/ Treatment","Not getting peoples clothes mixed up putting them on other people. Often things were missing and mixed up."
"Access to Services","To continue to come."

"Access to Services","I would like this type of session to be on a permanent basis."
"Care/ Treatment","I was told this course might lead to making friendships. Not a hope. I was the odd one out, not from Sutton! All chat was re work  and  happenings in Sutton. No one even asked where I came from, what been MY work, MY experiences. I felt very left out."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More consultants to deal with referrals. I have waited for 3 months on this occasion. Not good."
"Environment/Facilities","The consulting room had a cold feel more like a store room. The psychologist may not use this room often that was the reason it looked the way it did?"
"Care/ Treatment","Time keeping"
"Care/ Treatment","At home personal carers should be capable of dealing with individual mental health problems."
"Access to Services","Wish the group/day service was closer to home address"
"Access to Services","Would like to come for longer, more weeks."
"Environment/Facilities","Confusing reception at Lings Bar (Parkside), no one there to ask and instruction to ring bell but no bell! Not the best setup for someone with a mental health issue."
"Care/ Treatment","I think level 1, 2, and 3 should be in different wards instead of being all together."
"Communication","The night staff should listen ?????"
"Involvement","If my family could access my belongings so they can replenish anything that has run out and exchange things that I have used."
"Care/ Treatment","I attended as a carer on Wed Feb 6th 2013. The talk on Alzheimer's Dementia was very helpful - it started a bit late, so finished late. Consequently the talk by Nelson Solicitor X X started late and there was a lot of facts and information given VERY quickly, with many technical terms; I fear that the listeners missed some of the vital points."
"Care/ Treatment","More activities. 1 to 1."
"Access to Services","Longer sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","More activities. 1 to 1."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Stop trying to push patients into sheltered accommodation in inappropriate areas far away from friends and relatives. Some of my friends who had psychiatric care in B1 and B2 were so housed, and now my appointed social worker is trying to do the same with me! No Way! Harworth, Worksop, two places I hate no friends, relatives with in 12 miles. Retford I want. "
"Safety","I am the patients wife and I am distressed that my husband went into ward B1 at Bassetlaw hospital on Christmas day with a gold cross and chain around his neck and never came out with it on. This cross and chain is 50 years old, and means a lot to my husband who is a practicing catholic, someone knows where it is, and I I want to know they have been asked, but no one wants to know. X X."
"Food","Diet. Big 5 none existent. Fruit monoculture oranges, bananas, apples, one kind each day. Health advise dietary, by dietician based on fact not fancy."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","As a service user I feel during my stay in hospital I wasn't shown enough respect."
"Care/ Treatment","Making the medication on discharge easier to understand."
"Food","The food/dietary intake."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff to be genuinely interested in the well-being of patients. Although quite good at reacting there is little pro action"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Old way off running wards, with matron and bleach,and more staff on the shop floor.running hospital is not a bussiness."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not to have intermittent observations in the first 24 hours. Nursing staff are too busy with paper work rather than nursing patients. The service should employ more admin staff so nurses can nurse."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","There should be more emphasis on getting all the staff to follow the lead of the exceptional one. I think that sometimes staff don't put patients whole needs first. They don't see each patient as an individual."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Nursing staff too busy doing paper work. I know this is not their fault."
"Access to Services","Length of service."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Kind people but unable to really understand the difficulties."

"Access to Services","More support when you need it when someone has passed away in your family."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff and doctor."
"Care/ Treatment","When I was admitted to Rampton I was placed on a high dependency unit. I feel the structure there is outdated and needs to be changed. It is draconian and entirely punitative. There should be a more robust and straight forward complaints procedure. We should be allowed in Rampton PS2 and Xbox 360 games consoles as they are in prison as well as DVDs. These things are allowed in prisons. Please end the punative ban."
"Communication","The information and help service. Although to run a place like Rampton hospital you need to place the trust in somebody at the end of the day and the buck lies mainly with the staff on the wards. There is a kind of ??? In this system although the staff to my knowledge are generally fair enough all-round."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Close the whole hospital and start again."
"Communication","To listen more "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Sack the Psychiatrist Dr X."
"Care/ Treatment","Stop telling patients they are to be locked out of their side rooms when they are late for Food/Meds, it is abusive, especially when most who are late are due to sedation from the medication, and not their fault. It is abuse."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff have no respect for patients. They wind patients up. Make bullying comments. Staff are bullies."
"Communication","Set out your stall. Are you telling me you are going to get a murderer free in 5 years, or are you going to treat someone for mental illness (however long that might take). Lets be honest remove a return to society from the agenda."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff."
"Care/ Treatment","More ward activities."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have enough staff to facilitate things on ward and off ward."

"Care/ Treatment","To handle money. To learn how to cope in a medium secure."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Being treated like a person who is here to be helped and not by your crime, as some staff judge badly on type of crime and bring it up on every possible occasion makng you feel like you aren't trying to change, want to change and can't change in their eyes on type crime and life that the person led before isn't related and it is."
"Involvement","More input in making decisions about my treatment although it is good it could be improved."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Nothing, but I think it would help to have more staff."
"Food","The food could be better. More activities."
"Leave","More freedom to move around, more activities especially weekends."
"Food","What could be improved is the meals as I hardly ate anything as the menu is very poor."
"Care/ Treatment","Medication at dinner should be changed as you can be waiting a while!"
"Food","The food on the unit is very poor and is the only thing I would change as you need good food whilst detoxing."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The way the doctor listens and don't just fob you off. Food."
"Food","Better food, more choice, more of."
"Food","The food was atrocious and tasteless at the best."

"Care/ Treatment","NL advisors being able to prescribe Chempi x"
"Access to Services","Faster postage of NRT vouchers"
"Access to Services","Perhaps a phone service late into the night, when most people get urge to smoke."
"Care/ Treatment","I think that the units should aim to get every patient to maintenance and educate as it is so hard in the real world. My therapist went on sick which I found challenging but she was excellent at handing over my care."
"Communication","Mail sent to home address after requesting not to be although this was dealt with extremely well and I was informed immediately the mistake was realised."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Receptionist announced quite loudly that I was there for an eating disorder  and  the waiting area had others waiting. This increased my anxiety levels."
"Food","Would have perhaps liked a cup of tea."
"Care/ Treatment","I understand that the service has to cover a lot of patients, but this means appointment times are sparse + finding a time that suited me and my therapist was hard. I feel I would have benefitted from group + sessions (other than my one on one therapy)."
"Access to Services","Nothing - just more funding to access more people in more places but I received all I needed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Service at GPs miscommunications, reception not especially polite or welcoming manner. Considering moving GPs."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","No break in care when my psychologist went away."
"Access to Services","My therapist only does a clinic on Wednesday at the QMC, which is the most difficult day for me to have appointments because I have clinical placements on Wednesdays."

"Access to Services","That I could have received it earlier and not have to wait for a year."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","That I was treated as a person not just like they have to be there with me."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","All staff should be aware and up to date with the benefits system. Take into account most of us on welfare are really struggling- cuts in payments, losing our homes etc."
"Communication","The therapist should improve their communication with doctors and psychiatrists/mental health workers involved in my treatment. There was hardly any feedback given to my doctor and psychiatrist, so they could not really advise me on anything concerning my therapy. Therefore I often feel unsafe during therapy. The therapist also needs to respond more to my specific needs during sessions. also waiting time (almost 10 months) for therapy is too long."
"Access to Services","Quicker access to service - from GP. Referral to receipt of provision."
"Communication","To be given an idea of how long the waiting list is or written confirmation that I was on the waiting list."
"Access to Services","Purely length of time waited for referral + then for a therapist after assessment, though I do appreciate some of that was my availability. Childcare is a huge issue preventer of access to sessions and adds stress to getting o sessions. Perhaps help with it? Do appreciate the cost!!!"
"Access to Services","Maybe to carry on sessions for longer."
"Access to Services","I wish the sessions could be later in the day as employers are not helpful about taking time off work."
"Access to Services","Inflexibility of appointments. Only available on one day of the week. Sometimes did not fit in with family commitments. Communication could ne improved re: appointment times, what to expect and also how the therapy fits in with mental health teams elsewhere, also treating me."
"Access to Services","More sessions available of 'EMDR', or knowing this therapy was available to trauma victims earlier. To me personally, my life would have benefitted, with an understanding years earlier. ' A better quality of life'. 1 Hour sessions are not enough for a life time of trauma."
"Access to Services","The waiting list to see people are away too long. It takes a lot of strength to talk to people and the lists are just too long, It takes a long time to get to the right person."
"Access to Services","To improve transfer from prisons to hospitals (red tape policies). To allow more information and be allowed to be more involved in all meetings."
"Access to Services","Waiting times for intervention."
"Communication","Won't listen to me about medicines. Think they know best."

"Access to Services","If things could be moved along more quickly."
"Care/ Treatment","One thing is making sure your tablets are there for you on time."
"Care/ Treatment","I need a tooth that needs taking out and it keeps getting infected and all they keep doing is cleaning it."
"Involvement","Be involved and told. Be treated as I was outside."
"Access to Services","For staff to listen and help, not just say ok and do nothing. I was referred 2 years ago for my hands. I'm still waiting. I was also referred 10 months ago for cataracts and bleeding behind the eyes. I'm still waiting. Eyesight getting worse. Legal team not happy, and will be taking action. Asking for cromorph at 6pm and getting it 11.35pm on a when required prescription and having to wait 3.5  hours. All bad staff. Not interested."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some services and interventions, at the same level as in the community rather than being treated with abject disdain by a minority of staff. Consistency, understanding, and access to required (and diagnosed) services. Issues still not resolved though, due to lack of services available. Ie Counselling - the counselling, as I have been diagnosed as requiring. Some staff members applling - abusive, dismissive, aggressive, disinterested, sarcastic and generally unprofessional  and  disgraceful conduct."
"Care/ Treatment","Don't remove much needed medication again. There will just because other people have misused it in the past. We are all different  and  should not be tarred with the same brush."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Review all the staff, including doctors."
"Access to Services","Been resolved more quickly"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","To make it the same as you get on the street."

"Access to Services","Try to do it more quickly"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Make the doctors see we all ain't trying to get medication to get high on."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","For Doncaster + Humberside NHS and Sheffield to take over."
"Care/ Treatment","Getting my 'medications' in the fist instance. (Disgusting)"
"Access to Services","How long it takes to see a doctor, also when they all of a sudden decide to start reducing you off different medication, also saying that they don't prescribe certain meds when they clearly do."

"Access to Services","When you put applications in they take long to hear back from them."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Being able to get better advice from the doctor and better help with mental health and better ease to tablets that I need for pain in my arms."
"Care/ Treatment","Stop treating us all as criminals and stop giving us medication which does not work, just cos you don't want to give certain meds out and getting meds for mental health and seeing someone from time ou come in shouldn't take weeks before you get help."
"Care/ Treatment","Give you the medication you need not think that everyone's on a blag, and give everyone paracetamol or buraphen for everything."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The time the care and the doctors opinion. Just cos we're in prison we are still people. Missed my methadone twice and not got told the routine."

"Care/ Treatment","More appointment time."
"Food","Cup of coffee in sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","Detox schedule + maintenance."

"Care/ Treatment","More time."
"Access to Services","See doctor"

"Access to Services","Not to have to wait weeks to see the doctor, then have to wait up to a month to receive our medication having to see the nurse before the doctor slows down things."
"Access to Services","I have only got a month left and when I visited the dentist after waiting 3 and a half months I was told they could only do emergency work on me with having less than 6 months left so all my fillings that need fixing are continuosly getting worse. The dentist will still get paid if he did them so  this needs addressing as it's more work for my dentist outside to do it if I can get one straight away."

"Access to Services","Staff believe that you are in pain, but generally I have been treated well, the mental health team are brilliant. X was also good for this, but the waiting time for doctors is really bad. I am still waiting 3 months ago."
"Access to Services","Doctor waiting time is very poor. Sometimes you may wait in healthcare waiting room all afternoon, only to be told doctor has decided to cancel all apointments. It may take a further 4 weeks before you see him again."
"Access to Services","Wheel chair access and faster appointments. It takes to long to see a dentist and we don't have a podiatrist on site yet."
"Care/ Treatment","Faster appointments."
"Access to Services","Waiting list for treatments."

"Access to Services","I've had to wait too long for dentist."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","At HMP Moorland the IDTS Dr is a fool. He don't listen and just reduces people like me on Methadone. I was put on methadone in prison why am I been took off it now my release is coming up. If I'm off methadone I'll have to smoke or inject heroin to go back on it. Which is silly.

"Communication","Some of us are not after a cheap buzz provided by the NHS we really have things wrong with us."

"Care/ Treatment","Find out WHY they are putting the patient in this service, whether the patient need to be at  all under these services, whether the so called patient is correctly diagnosed in the first place or not AND whether the patient is at risk of really becoming ill under the services because of the type of resident that they are kept with, the service is completely unsuitable for mixed level patients for example age difference, illness level, social level, intelligence and so on.

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not received any at present."
"Environment/Facilities","Transport booked for 2 p.m. appointment. Transport arrived at 1 50 p.m. (Retford) for appointment at Bassetlaw Worksop. Still had two patients to collect. Therefore had to cancel appointment as would have been home very late."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","For gods sake department must work as one not dumping a patient from one department to the next. It cost NHS more in the long run. I was at Bassetlaw hospital. I complained about a nurse attitude to a patient I had to apologise pore sod she was on her own on a shift cost cutting at patients pain."
"Access to Services","Waiting time."
"Environment/Facilities","The system for transport bookings was not helpful as we had booked a return but it wasn't on the system and the person in charge was not helpful."
"Communication","Filling this in for my wife who has dementia was difficult. I have not seen any of the medical staff apart from the nurses and my wife is unable to give me her opinions. For myself I would have appreciated meeting the consultant and generally being given more information about her condition. The many changes of nursing staff made it difficult to get such information."
"Food","Nothing all good, except I like not having to rush in the mornings for breakfast. Like to do it at my own leisure, not to a set time."
"Environment/Facilities","Sometimes the transport could be a little better."
"Communication","Follow up guidelines to be made more clear. "
"Access to Services","I would like it if services could visit us sometimes instead of us visiting. If you don't drive  and  have problems walking. Taxi is so expensive."

"Safety","Better security for patients belongings e.g. lockers with locks. Stories about clothes being taken."
"Leave","My freedom when demanded. I have not committed any offence to anyone. Why am I still imprisoned?"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To be believed. I feel due to my mental health issues, nobody believes me, not just doc, nurses, my own family, and blame me 'Oh! It's her on one again!' I have worked all my life, also managed my life even though from young I have had mental health issues , OCD and depression."
"Care/ Treatment","It would be to get proper structured care for my husband. A 10 min appointment every 6 months with a different doctor every time is not acceptable. The doctor seemed to thing the same as I because I was offered the option of not attending any more. As for the staff I saw one doctor and one receptionist. There is no care offered at Millbrook for my husband's dementia - it is a farce when I asked for 4 days respite the social worker said 'what do you want respite for?' - try looking after my husband 24/7 and you wouldn't need to ask that question  and  please stop changing social workers - It makes a difficult situation worse."
"Care/ Treatment","Should have seen the psychiatrist. Staff involved being able to do more."

Small  room for consultation - not very homely or comfortable. Is an option to do assessment in our home? In appointment letter it would be helpful to be told how long the visit will last."
"Access to Services","That there was sufficient money to enable dementia sufferers to have  on-going contact."
"Access to Services","That it would last longer. Excellent service."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Enjoyed the group very much but lets have some more staff. They seem busy all of the time and run off their feet doing all the activities."
"Care/ Treatment","The meetings should be longer sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","I believe if my husband's diagnosis had been found earlier he would have had a better quality of life earlier on. Therefore I would suggest that scans are carried out if Alzheimer's disease is suspected as a matter of course."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A friendly welcome + our names checked in and an assurance that we would be seen, although Dr. was running late would have been appreciated. [We arrived in good time for my husband's 11.30 appointment with Dr. X on 13/06/13. A receptionist directed us to a waiting area but did not take our names. We then waited for 30 mins (we accept that hospital appointments unavoidably run late) until a team member finally came and asked if we were 'all right'.] We felt that with patients mental health problems and their carers a little more courtesy + reassurance would not go amiss."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times."
"Environment/Facilities","Your own room with access to your clothes when wanted - not locked."
"Communication","As a carer/wife contacting staff for an update via the telephone was difficult.

"Access to Services","I would change the time of coming to longer."
"Communication","Keeping to time slots allotted to speakers."
"Access to Services","This is not directly related to the occupational therapist but service could have been arranged sooner i.e. months ago had my mother's G.P followed up my phone call last December. He said he would assess mum again and he went in March. Immediate referral to dementia outreach team who to date have done nothing - two months later. (now mid May("
"Environment/Facilities","Transport"
"Care/ Treatment","Get Alzheimer's society to turn up on time, or not at all. Their presentation was mostly 'Medical Model' and conflicted with the 'Person Centred' aims of the CST."
"Communication","Perhaps information about therapy used so as to understand more of what is done at different sessions."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get a decent consultant who can speak English (X), has more empathy and some decent social skills  and  stops changing their mind."
"Communication","Given some information in the understanding why you have arrived in this healthcare service."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some members of the team were very young and inexperienced. They need more patience in working with older people."

However, once the social workers team were involved, I was kept fully informed regarding what was required on my part to help rehabilitate and move my brother into his present accommodation."
"Communication","The nursing team handed over to carers without discussion as to things etc. and that seems to lack sense. A main aim was supposedly to encourage independence and joining in but the one activity my mother is starting to re-join clashes with her medication/meal visit. My mother is likely to refuse the visits and miss her medication as her Alzheimer's limits memory/rationality."
"Access to Services","Feel things stopped over the weekends, not just this team, but all NHS unless very urgent. Then excellent."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Having the same care worker each time."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","We did not know what to expect and we got everything we needed. It is just a shame that the private carers are not as experienced with mental health problems."
"Communication","Being allowed to discuss with all and questions."
"Access to Services","Social worker did not follow up, was very high handed about me bringing my husband home - my husband nearly died after 2 weeks respite care in care home - 5 weeks in hospital."
"Access to Services","I would have liked to continue coming to Parkside say Unit indefinitely but quite understand the need for it to cease due to resources being limited."
"Access to Services","It would be marvellous if the resources at Parkside Hospital could continue - hope that similar resources will be implemented."
"Involvement","Less form filling."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A different approach from the majority of staff. Sometimes slapdash. Sometimes plain rude. Too unsuitably dressed almost as though going to a rave up at a club!"
"Access to Services","More support when you need it when someone has passed away in your family."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff and doctor."
"Care/ Treatment","When I was admitted to Rampton I was placed on a high dependency unit. I feel the structure there is outdated and needs to be changed. It is draconian and entirely punitive. There should be a more robust and straight forward complaints procedure. We should be allowed in Rampton PS2 and Xbox 360 games consoles as they are in prison as well as DVDs. These things are allowed in prisons. Please end the punitive ban."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Close the whole hospital and start again."
"Communication","To listen more "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Sack the Psychiatrist Dr X."
"Care/ Treatment","Stop telling patients they are to be locked out of their side rooms when they are late for Food/Meds, it is abusive, especially when most who are late are due to sedation from the medication, and not their fault. It is abuse."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff have no respect for patients. They wind patients up. Make bullying comments. Staff are bullies."
"Communication","Set out your stall. Are you telling me you are going to get a murderer free in 5 years, or are you going to treat someone for mental illness (however long that might take). Lets be honest remove a return to society from the agenda."

"Care/ Treatment","To handle money. To learn how to cope in a medium secure."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Being treated like a person who is here to be helped and not by your crime, as some staff judge badly on type of crime and bring it up on every possible occasion making you feel like you aren't trying to change, want to change and can't change in their eyes on type crime and life that the person led before isn't related and it is."
"Involvement","More input in making decisions about my treatment although it is good it could be improved."

"Access to Services","Getting in quicker to see a doctor when you put in to see one."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","That was more care when it came to people's mental health problems. The CPN I was seeing called me steve in front of me and my problems people. When my name is X."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","For the staff and doctor to treat me on my merits and not just as a prisoner we are treated like children. Before coming to this prison I was at HMP Bedford. While at bedford I was meant to do a detox on subtex as I was out in 7 weeks. That would mean I was 3 weeks clean when released from custody but I was transferred to stocken. While here I was informed that I could only go subtex 2 weeks before release. This means I'm being released with an addiction which ain't no good to me. I've been in prison 21 month because of an addiction now I'm being released with one. Your system is a JOKE. I haven't received the care I would receive in the community and because of that I contacted my solicitor and as their advice regarding sueing this healthcare . I already have an ongoing claim against HMP Wayland Healthcare for the same reasons, Myself and 19 other prisoners have contacted my solicitors regarding the IDTS system within Stocken and the local policy."
"Access to Services","More time with IMHT"
"Access to Services","In other prison when like now when I've got madness, I have been able to go to the healthcare to become better. Then when I become better I've gone back to my wing, but here I've asked to go to healthcare and I even asked Dr. X who put it in his computer weeks ago? As yet I am stil living with this madness. But you lot think it's a joke so there's still not anything good about the mental health care here is there? As it's a fact that you don't listen to us inmates as this is proof and you don't help people like me, do you? It's as if you're not interested to help?"
"Care/ Treatment","That it was tailored towards specific diagnosis I have been labelled with during my assessmentt over the years i.e. not just bipolar. (Borderline P.D, avoidant P.D, PT.S.D) More pertinently, as these all respond well to document treatment methods in the community. As I must show a reduction in risk in order to progress, but cannot seeminglt access and D.B.T, trauma counselling etc for the above while in high security conditions, I am in a Catch 22. I would urge, therefore that this be looked at carefully, as via my cat (a) and location, I am prevented access to perfectly effacious treatments - and then criticised for not having had treatment or changed risk!"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Longer 1 to 1 sessions."

"Access to Services","To have a one to one on a weekly basis in a private environment away from staff as they know too much and will use it against you as some form of power trip I like things to stay strictly confidential but that's not always the case there's only a few people I will trust and confide in and that's a few mental health nurses and mainly psychiatrist."
"Food","There would be food/drink available throughout the night and food was aloud to be taken with patients to their rooms if they couldn't consume it in the allocatated food times. 13 hours is a long time to be locked in a cell by oneself whne feeling lonely, isolated, vulnerable or hungry/thirsty."
"Environment/Facilities","The room I see Doctor X in is too small. I feel too close to him and I don't like it. I don't feel comfortable around him."
"Access to Services","Would get to see them more."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time on one to one counselling. To do group therapy with simiar situations sexual/violent abuse as it would be a lot of help for everyone in a group meeting, maybe one day in every calendar month. To do meditation, yoga, light floor exercise for all emotional aspects of people oin a group even if it's for 1 hour it would could a lot of self harming down. Just an idea that I'd like to be a really success for all inviolved."
"Care/ Treatment","I have answered 'poor' in response to question 7 - however I believe the service, in my case, was very restricted due to the fact that I am only  on remand (and have been for 9 months!). I am very pleased , and have a great deal of respect for the team which has been seeing/talking to me, but I have now spent so much time (due to my 'remand' status) without a 'tailor-made' package, that I now feel it is far too late i feel much worse! ACCT Reviews - I realise that ACCT revies do not really fall within your remit but I have several concerns (as do many other women) regards same:- 1) therre does not appear to be a great deal of  continuity - in that (in my case at least) different members of staff have attended each time, this leads to women having to relate exactly the same thoughts and worries time and time again, a process that leaves women with the impression that they have not been listened to in the first instance - resulting in a lack of confidence in the ACCT process itself! In my case, for example 'you do not self-harm do you?' has been asked at several reviews. In actual fact I do - and this has been (or so I thought) documented many months ago. Other women have given me several more examples. We all find this embarrassing to discuss, when we are all at our lowest ebb - without having to relate time and time again. 2) We all feel that women should not be outnumbered by men at an ACCT review - I have yet to meet an inmate who is happy about this! Continuity should and could be maintained by having at least one member of staff being present at an inmates review each and every time - if officers cannot attend then perhaps:- a) A nurse, b) IMB member, C) Listener etc or perhaps 'postpone' an ACCT review so that the inmates 'personal officer' can be in attendence each time? (that is assuming tha thte inmate would agree to it, and gets on with them - not all prisoners do!). 4) All ACCT reviews should be held in a more appropriate setting - and not in an office with constant interruptions. Every woman I have spoken to has mentioned that:- a) The interruptions upset them!, b) they cannot concentrate and feel uncomfortable and 'in the way', c) They feel you are not concentrating on what they say and therefore they are an 'after thought' when they are feeling at their worst  and  depressed and suicidal, d) They feel 'hurried' and that you have more important things to do - undermining them. 5) When officers conduct checks on women durng the night it would be a good idea if they all followed a set procedure:-  1) Put night light on first, if no response, 2) put main light on, if no response 3) then knock, if no response 4) then shout!....some officers are unnecesarily noisy and disturb everyone else on the wing - leading to the person on the ACCT being confronted the next morning. This is the last thing they need when depressed and suicidal! A bit more consideration would go a long way! Not only that I believe sleep deprivation is the root cause of a great deal of the stress and anxiety many prisoners feel. We work from 9am to 5pm and should all be allowed the opportunity of uninterrupted sleep - as the officers are! I feel that all inmates - wehter sentenced or on  remand should be assessed and treated equally. Many inmates - such as myself - are on remand for many months - some for over a year. Please beleive me when I tell you that many of these women need help immdediately - this is mainly due to the fact that when on remand EVERYTHING is so uncertain and frightening. PS I have been waiting since 25th october '12 for new prescription glasses - so please excuse my 'scribble'. I can only just read it myself. pps I am aware that the opticians are from a private company, out of your control."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","I would not send a dead dog to this place, or anything that is breathing."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff should be having meals (on A43) with patients. I feel you get to know nurses better, and they have time to speak to patients. That's if staff would like to eat with us. It's their decision to do so and patient's too. We are the only ward not to have this. please it's important we should have a room of our own. It's hard sleeping with noise and lights on."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Equality. Thing's are improving!"
"Involvement","24 Sept that said I had to have them meds or I would be pin down. Human rights laws, and I have told the lawyers. This place need shutting down before someone dies."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Need to be shut down before someone get hurt for real."
"Communication","Communication with staff especially at shift changes. My son was let off the ward unescorted, the day after he was brought back by the police and I had also rung the ward and spoke to a member of staff informing them that my son had the intention of committing suicide. He ran away the next day and came home and tried to kill himself. I found him."

"Care/ Treatment","No 8? You help a person to feel relaxed, to share a problem. Rather than a person deciding for themselves what is best for them. You help them to reason on the matter based upon a person's needs re: health and society."
"Communication","Staff don't make assumptions (I'am not straight so don't ask about boyfriends) Also, that they actually listen to my concerns and don't compare me to other service users - not helful."
"Care/ Treatment","Act upon what you say and not just dismiss your feelings. The fact that the service drops you after a couple of week regardless of your mental state."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I have been treated appallingly by the crisis team and the hospital. Will be making a formal complaint. I cannot tell you how much suffering I have experienced over the last two months. You need to take a serious look at this service and how you treat people. The counsellors were heartless and compassionless."
"Communication","Having a psychiatrist be able to BSL so that not everyone in room as make hard to talk with everyone. When I was in B2, for 4 months no one with deaf aware or interpreters was very frustrating and difficult - I felt it slowed my recovery on B2.

"MHA","I was sectioned under the MHA and locked up on a mental health ward. I was very frightened and felt that I was a criminal and was being arrested. I felt that the experience could have been dealt with in a more understanding and non- confrontational manner. i had only attempted to harm myself and I had harmed no one else."
"Communication","Prior to presenting our selves at A and E we had contacted the crisis team. The service we received was bad. Poor communications, lack of understanding of the distress we both were in. No support give, so 3 days later we had to use A and E. What about the experienced core of these services."

"Food","Improve the food. Sometimes not enough. - Not enough sauces. Food is bland, pasta is dry."

I am the sole carer for my father and felt very happy having 6 monthly checks with dad's CPN. It was what I considered my 'safeguard'. Fortunately my father's physical health is very good and he is discharged from this service. I feel he has been very let down. It would seem he has been abandoned. So much for the care of the older generation!"
"Access to Services","Because my memory loss condition seems fairly stable it was suggested that appointments should be discontinued. As this is only once a year, I would very much like to be able to continue with my appointments, to measure if the condition has got worse, it is extremely re-assuring to hear if test results are ok."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More respect from CPN"

So it could be improved for us by constant monitoring of the patietnt, this was how it was."

"Access to Services","To receive your medication on the next working day after you come in. The service is poor especially at weekends as no provisions are there and the wait could be 3-4 days without medication which is not acceptable.

"Access to Services","After care."
"Privacy and Dignity","Greater privacy"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The services was excellent at first, but as time went on it seemed to me to get worse and poorer. I feel there could be much  a lot more improvements. This time on A43 ward more ??? With physical situations and in social needs. I feel there could have been a lot more support and guidance in HCA staff talking to you at the same time writing it down in front of you. More one to one for ???social needs. PS. We need more ???? on the ward."
"Smoking","Regarding the escorted staff smoke breaks If the patient is under section the patient must be treated fairly and transparently relating to specific times and duration  of breaks  and  when indicated to the patient, and adhered to  and  that the patient must also understand the pressures of the underpaid understaffed staff."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","CPNs as required."
"Care/ Treatment","When the mental care team came first it was no use - just counselling me. GPs were useless. They didn't have a clue. I needed to see a specialist and that's a psychiatrist. When X X came she was brilliant. I got a referral straight away to Highbury hospital psychiatrist who diagnosed and prescribed correctly. GP gave me Fluoxine which made me MORE suicidal."

"Smoking","The smoking need to be sorted out so people on the ward can go out more time or all day."

"Care/ Treatment","OT is very important. It is a shame there was no funding for it. Also some group therapy would be helpful."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think people with a serious breakdown of mental health functioning may need more prompting or help  and  encouragement to drink or eat because when a patient feels unable to think straight and feels tired and doesn't care much for life the last thing they think about is food or even a drink. The food wasn't really very good and wasn't warm. Although good portions."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Sometimes when I am on the ward, not enough staff on. X and X been really good to me."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","CPN nurses should be more available."

"Communication","Signpost directions in and outside the building."
"Communication","I just recently got told that next term will be my last at the college, I didn't know there was a time limit and neither did anyone else I know at the college so it came as a shock and has affected me in a negative way.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More psychiatrists as Dr V thorough to a fault almost. She needs assistance if she will accept it."
"Communication","Check G.P surgeries have the correct contact details for the crisis team. Newgate St def had the wrong number, when I first enquired early 2013 they gave out the number for Bassetlaw Business Park, who in turn gave us the number of the rape crisis team."
"Care/ Treatment","Since I was discharged from the crisis team on 06.11.13, I have not received any contact from anyone!! I feel a bit let down. I am not sure what to do now. The community psychiatric nurse I was told would be seeing me, yet no sign!!"

"Care/ Treatment","Child/Adult transition should be done over a bit longer period of time."
"Communication","I would like to be listened to more as I feel that decisions were made for me, sometimes without me even being told.

"Environment/Facilities","Better facilities for the professional to work in."
"Communication","I attended with my mother who is beginning to have memory problems. I would have welcomed the opportunity to speak to the nurse alone as I did not want to appear harsh to my mother, in contradicting my mother in the extent of her problem.

"Care/ Treatment","To be able to collect my medication on time on the weekends."
"Access to Services","The care I receive is good, but it is difficult to see the doctor if urgent or have to go via the ATM. Sometimes a week or two wait to see a doctor, at my age, 65, is too long."
"Communication","I think it would be helpful if there was more collaboration between mental health  and  the GP/General Healthcare as I believe that mental health can be affected by physical problems such as pain  and  from my experience they are seen as two separate  aspects when in fact I believe the two are closely connected  and  quite co-dependent. Poor physical health can impact on mental health  and  I think if both worked closer together an overall better outcome could be achieved."

I'm concerned over this as my outside probation (x) sees the above as 'emotional instability' - and implies it as a 'risk'. This is an obscene interpretation in any professionals eyes - yet probation who have the most impact on parole decisions - and they are the ones making this interpretation which I feel they are not qualified to do."
"Communication","To see the Dr. about my coughing blood, and shitting blood, and lumps on my chest. Also I require meds for my panic attacks. I keep on at the stupid rent-a-nurses each time I see them, but I still have not been booked in to see the dr. This is neglect."
"Care/ Treatment","In relation to my physical health, I experience undue pain to which the pain relief given is not appropriate. I have seen the Dr and he just fobbed me off. The Dr in healthcare treats me the same as others who try + some succeed in obtaining pain relief medication when they don't even need it. So I am seen as a pill popping druggy (in my opinion) by the General Dr and does not provide the same as you get on the outside. It gets me down so much that with my depression which feeds very negative thoughts concerning self harm as relief + can not carry on with positives as it is preventable."

This is not happening at Ranby Prison - more often than not prisoners meds have not been reordered and we must go without until supply is obtained."

That is to prevent the need to request that wing duty officers telephone healthcare to make an appointment in the absence of a slip. This type of appointment not always amenable to some officers. having been on paracetamol pain killers for in excess of one year I find they are quite useless for killing the stabbing pain in my legs causing lack of sleep at nights and then drowsiness during core day. review required to update medication when necessary."

"Care/ Treatment","The time in which you see the doctor, it could be more on a regular basis."
"Care/ Treatment","Not having to be palmed off with the Gym when seeing the doctor for back pain. It's pain killers I want not a gym session."
"Care/ Treatment","As an IDTS user, we should have a set regime where we reduce, instead of agreeing to reduce on a day, then it doesn't happen. Also the doctor - should work with prisoners in the choice of meds needed not against."

"Care/ Treatment","In other hospital psychiatric wards (possibly the Hartington ward at chesterfield royal hospital), patients have a named nurse for each shift, and possibly a deputy - could this be helpful on ward B2 - with shift patterns, absences it is not always easy for a patient to have quality time with a named nurse they relate to."

"Access to Services","Seeing the family service earlier."
"Access to Services","More services for me to allow my wife (primary carer) to have a break."
"Access to Services","To have a carer support group in Ollerton. To have feedback from other carere. It's very lonely being a carer."
"Access to Services","The possibility to attend on a permanent or odd occasion a carer support group in Ollerton. I feel that the help I am receiving is good, but a carer needs to talk to other carers in a similar situation."
"Access to Services","For me, 2 days was not long enough to complete all events in the hand-outs, because you need more time to use scenarios verbally not physically, more time to talk out an issue - following. Just hand-outs don't work as some people tend to take in more information verbally and physically, not just reading!!"
"Communication","I would like to improve Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS trust by maintaining that nurses, support workers, doctors  and  consultants communicate with service users in a positive way and listen to the reason(s) that the service user has been admitted. To also show respect, maintain dignity and to make note of any dietary needs required by the service user and to ensure that these are adhered to. Also to provide service users with the correct information regarding the services and also to provide information regarding advocacy and solicitors contact details when requested. This should be made readily available on initial instance."
"Care/ Treatment","Need a sports group, or exercise class."
"Access to Services","A phone call at a certain time of day, everyday would have gone a long way to speeding my therapy and helping me to cope from day to day."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To have friendly staff at the reception."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff should show more interest in the patients rather than chatting between themselves."
"Care/ Treatment","More time in bed."
"Communication","It would be helpful if X could just give me the information I needed instead of asking my son's permission EVERY time I rang. Then go off and not come back to phone. It's a tough job but feel the staff do an excellent job. In Millbrook, Mansfield."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","That there was more time for talk time, to talk about our problems."
"Care/ Treatment","More activities on the ward and be able to spend more time off the ward. Keeping fit."
"Environment/Facilities","Maybe to have a key just to certain patients doors to stop interrupting members of the staff to unlock the door as they are very busy, especially in emergencies."
"Involvement","For doctors to tell/discuss when they change/amend medication. The doctors/consultant seem to be only reactive to initial problems,  and  do not work proactively with your recovery. Was told that the cost of certain medication was a factor when trying new tablets, i.e. one type is used on the ward  and  no alternative is available."
"Care/ Treatment","More activity groups. Makes time go much faster, and it takes your mind off this."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","*Staff to be a bit more caring and compassionate. *To stop looking down their nose at people (staff). * To be more understanding when it is someone's first time being on millbrook. * To listen before interrupting patients whilst talking. *This is only some staff not all staff. *I found all the staff on Orchid ward fantastic, it was only a few on Lucy Wade."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get X rid of X doesn't fit. His favourite is 'what do you think this is, a hospital?'"
"Environment/Facilities","Care. Regarding personal hygiene/safety. The bathroom on Orchid ward needs an update re: elderly/vulnerable. I got stuck in the bath as I am large and the bath is medium. I was facing taps at the time so I could not reach the buzz and could find no grab rail. I was yelling and shouting but staff were busy with others but what if.....?"

"Service Quality/Outcomes","More support and structure implemented to the independentness."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time for therapist."
"Access to Services","Ideally consulatant would be available at shorter notice but in a crisis he was available. My intial GP referral to first meeting with psychiatrist was several months."
"Care/ Treatment","A key worker that we could refer to."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would be good to have one person to see rather than different people each time so a history of my condition can be made."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","To provide effective and full diagnosis help for depression illness. You just go round in circles being passed from one person to the next, appointments but no real help at all. I just keep going back - at least there is someone if you book an appointment. It's a very poor service for mental health support. It's a waste of money being passed around endlessly. You are disinterested. No one has the time of day for you. No one really cares anymore. It's pills, a quick chat and 'be on your way'. sadly there's a good chance I will end my life sooner or later, because the help I need is not there for me."
"Access to Services","Computerised booking system to manage appointments and enable reception staff to inform doctors/therapist patient has arrived. Also to better manage doctor hours. - Provision of mindfulness training for patients. -Do not push medication as first option for patients."
"Access to Services","That it should be available to all,  (even) better signposted."

"Access to Services","More services for loved one. All groups have gone."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Less baby talk."
"Access to Services","Home visits to have started sooner."
"Access to Services","Send someone to the house quicker rather than having to travel to thorneywood centre, as it was very difficult for me."
"Care/ Treatment","Motivational strategies. Proactive, ot just talking about feelings, actual practical activities around coping and motivation."
"Communication","Actually be seen and my concerns about my daughter be taken seriously.  Staff should communicate with each other to ensure a robust service, no one appears to know what is happening with my daughters care and I am extremely unhappy tto be told on the phone it is unlikely she is suitable for your service despite being referred by tier two services, and despite your service never actually seeing her!  No one has got back to me despite the concerns I have raised about my daughters wellbeing."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would like more 1:1 sessions and I would not want to feel punished everytime I do something wrong.There are too many bank staff that don't interact with us and not enough regular staff."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything."
"Communication","Be listened to by staff. More confidential information respected - overheard converstaions about myself."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Give allocated time to named nurses - e.g. if the ward is busy - your time with your named nurse can/may be cancelled. "
"Care/ Treatment","Provide better and various activity groups. "

"Access to Services","Shorter waiting list for initial diagnosis."
"Access to Services","Should be available to everyone not just city people."
"Environment/Facilities","Extremely concerned at not being able to make anyone hear the doorbell at the unit, nor get anyone to answer the telephone when calling. The unit is large and there is not a system in place to amplify door/telephone bell sounds when away from the office area. Distress caused for carer when being unable to contact the unit."
"Access to Services","More flexibility to allow deop in service for couple of hours when needed rather than just total day/night requirenment as needed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Our first ward (Daybrook) - lack of consultant - hardly suprising as one retired and the ward is due to be closed (?) next October. This delayed any psychiatric diagnosis for several weeks."
"Physical Health","No one is dealing with my heart trouble. I'm in the wrong hospital."
"Communication","Communication at all times. Explanation of situation at all times."
"Environment/Facilities","Less noise - environment amplifies noise."
"Care/ Treatment","Newspaper delivery"
"Communication","It would be helpful if 'Treatment' was discussed with patient concerned. As it was being administered."
"Food","The food."
"Food","Meals could be better."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Employ 2 diffenent Psychiatrists. The ones on ythe ward were far too busy to exchange even pleasantries for example, @hello, how are you feeling today, is there anything we can do to make your stay any more enjoyable@ they never had any time to converse with me."

"Food","Quite happy with the services. Would like double helpings of chocolate."
"Food","Better choice at meal times - same things over and over again. We need something different to encourage older people to eat more. Family all bring food in to give dad something to try. Why can't they have it one the ward?"
"Access to Services","They do a good job, but need to know support will be there when I go home."
"Communication","Communication on arrival - my dad was moved wards and we didn't know what was happening, and neither did the staff when we asked (though it was Christmas) dad's belongings were missing - we came in an emergency and wasn't told re labelling things - i.e. shaver glasses."
"Care/ Treatment","I don't know. I would have to think about it to find faults. Maybe sta in bed longer if I  wanted to."
"Care/ Treatment","Possibly - more stimulation for patients."

"Food","Meals more choice"
"Access to Services","Maybe follow up options locally, but a comprehensive list was offered of 'Fellowship' type groups which was interesting."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff required. Staff overstretched to care for patients. No time to help with toiletting, having a bath or shower."
"Care/ Treatment","Whilst an inpatient at the QMC I felt completely lost. Having nothing to occupy me all day was the worst thing for me, with very little contact from a professional. I came to the sheila gibson unit once, after leaving hospital and had an appointment from a psychiatrist (not dr X) it was disastrous, she was critical, totally lacking any of the understanding to how ill I was, in fact I would say her manner was cruel."
"Communication","A brochure/folder with the services available to patients (son  and  third party). My wife has dementia and we have had to find things out on an ad hoc basis."
"Access to Services","The time scales could be shorter. Had to wait 2 months for MRI scan, then 3 weeks + for follow up appointment to receive results so from initial Doctors appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","To have had more time to access activities. My problems were so complex that I felt the service would have helped me more. Could I have found, with help, activities that were positive to help fill my days."
"Communication","Written summary of proposed treatment - in post - to follow interview."
"Access to Services","Having to go to a ward at Mansfield was very difficult for my family to visit. We need to keep the local wards available."
"Care/ Treatment","Regular visits."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff continuity - it's important that patients see the same staff on a regular basis. We appreciate that NHS must change staff to progress but this does not help elderly patients who find it difficult to put their trust in different staff changes in the NHS system."
"Communication","A location map NOT provided. The notice on the front wall stated 'surgery'. There was no indication of Greenfields Medical Centre as I approached on foot from Noel St."
"Environment/Facilities","More shower rooms"
"Care/ Treatment","Medication given out 2 late at night"
"Communication","Comunition"
"Environment/Facilities","Somewhere a little more comfy to sit during visiting times."
"Care/ Treatment","Try for wider variety of activities."
"Environment/Facilities","I'm 67 years old and at times treated like a juvenile concerning health ie washing/showering in kingsley ward. Only one shower in the ladies area worked properly. You must put a new controlable shower in mens area. The shower in my room was frankly rubbish."
"Access to Services","Would like the occasional home visit."
"Environment/Facilities","Hospital transport would have been a lot easier for me. Instead of having to use taxis as it is difficult getting into cars (even if I payed of it)."
"Environment/Facilities","Transport never on time."
"Communication","Taking more time when I have to make a reply, need extra time with things."
"Access to Services","Extend the therapy courses for dementia patients."
"Access to Services","Better links with 'next steps' so no gap in support (14 week course with carer's session with info on what can be accessed but that means a gap in care/support)"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Higher staffing ratios."

"Care/ Treatment","More physical activities, more mental excercises."

"Access to Services","To have a shorter wait to see a psychologist."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get a new psychiatrist"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff available to spend one to one time with patients."
"Privacy and Dignity","Single sex wards as was very scared of the men on the ward. I was moved out of single ward to 4 bed room so the men could have the single room which upset me and caused confusion."
"Care/ Treatment","It's impossible, I suspect, but a bit more in depth knowledge of the patient would help both the carer  and  patient. However I do appreciate that this would be very difficult in most circumstances."
"Access to Services","To continue the change over is difficult!"
"Access to Services","To be able to provide a longer service."
"Access to Services","I found doing adequate shopping difficult to organise time for. I appreciated the limited number of occasions when some time was provided. A regular element of sitting time to allow shopping etc. would have been invaluable."
"Communication","Ensure good communication links between care Worker and Patient. Aim to work with patient to ensure they keep as independent as possible."
"Environment/Facilities","All ??? Helpers should be asked to make sure they know the 'know how' of bed making."
"Record Keeping","The Referral made to the community team assumed an incorrect home location, thus the referral was to the wrong community team."
"Communication","Give more information to the patient or carers/relatives. It was 2 weeks before a nurse explained the symptoms and causes of illness."
"Care/ Treatment","Should not stop abruptly - continue until other help can take over. Although this had nothing to do with my mums death a week after visits stopped it would have only been 2 weeks before I could have arranged alternative support."
"Care/ Treatment","It would be helpful to see the doctor who diagnosed the dementia."
"Access to Services","To be closer to home."
"Communication","That they ensure they respect patient requests. The initial psychologists letter stated that 'If you would rather not have a student attend' to contact the office. This was done but a student still attended."
"Access to Services","As service is mostly for elderly, more locations would be good as not everyone can travel."
"Communication","That I knew the name of the person to expect on their weekly visit. I was not always informed imn advance."

"Care/ Treatment","Proper nursing acting on needs of care "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Sack everybody "
"Environment/Facilities","Patients mail is sometimes held by mail examiners in the mail room for up to a week. Therefore is is late to the ward. This causes frustration and for people to become upset and it is an absolute disgrace and theres no excuse for it. "

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More deaf staff / awareness "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Nicer and more caring nursing assistants!!! "

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Many of the NAs are terrible people. "
"Communication","Communication "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","For more promises from and for staff like not ignoring a patient when he or she askes for something. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get rid of the bad staff on the peaks, and when someone assaults another patient I would not leave them on the same ward so the perpatrater can't try and intimidate the person he yhad assualted. And I would involve the law. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think the staff on the Peaks over exagerate things from old reports as if they are still happening even if you have changed due to treatment on new reports because they can't be bothered to think and the staff over on Malvern some staff find it funny to wind patients up on room searches taking things that patients can have out their rooms so when the patient complains the member of staff can write bad comments on their RiO records. "
"Care/ Treatment","For staff to be informed about a persons needs. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff wear NHS uniforms to distinguish them from patients More staff on wards Set staff on wards instead of several different ones per day.

"Care/ Treatment","Make the treatments or therapies shorter "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I would ask for more support and information geared to moving to an RSU. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Less emphasis on the peoples needs who work here and more on those that live here. As staffing issues seem to take priority over the patients and patients always loose out. Our resources are cut due to lack of staff. "

"Involvement","More transparency with decisions about my care. More communication so I can understand where I need to improve. Theres no support for victims of bullying "

"Privacy and Dignity","Use toilet in private without people watching you. "
"Privacy and Dignity","To be listened to and treated like a man, not dog. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To feel safe to approach staff (all) rather than select staff that care, others clearly don't. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff that don't bully/intimidate patients. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Ward to have own staffing pool and not to rely on bank staff system: This is due to trust issues and fear of abandonment "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Reduce the bad apples in the staff quarters (there still plenty) staff still bully it suit their needs. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Having a line so everyone knows where they stand no matter what Extra and regular staff. Social evenings to run. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time with nursing team to discuss my problems. Currently staff on the wards are overworked and are time constrained to the help they can offer. Having hope is vital - Shop does over charge like CD 15 pounds. The prices here are like service station. Lot's of bullying from personal insults to verbal abuse to passive aggressive behaviour done in the presence of staff and not challenged. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Spend more time out of my room to listen to my goals. "

"Care/ Treatment","For the mental health to stop making empty promises of help, as they'll say one thing and do another. I feel all the prisoners are suffering neglect at the hands of the sham they are calling healthcare.

As I would be able to be in the community, or if I werre a Cat B prisoner with access to Med-Sec Units, Arendon or Dovegate T.C.s.

"Involvement","Allowing rehab to be a decision made by the patient."

"Access to Services","Try to get a group in Ollerton, if at all possible. Would help greatly and not be such a strain on travel. Also it's lovely to be able to go on some trips with the group and gives me fun and I like that they take me for who I am and what I've got."

"Communication","Support tailored to carers needs to be accessed as soon as patient leaves hospital. 28 days for contact, then the assessment, 14 weeks to first support meeting is not realistic in crisis situations. Staff when doing assessment were needed to offload concerns that built up."
"Access to Services","More than four weeks would be better."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Better informed and trained staff within Adult mental health. More staff, more money and services for mental health patients."
"Communication","To communicate. Text service better."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","That the doctor I saw didn't seem to ask the correct questions."
"Privacy and Dignity","When posting out these feedback forms don't stamp crisis team on the envelope please."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Continuity of staff. Didn't like having to go over the same things with different people. I know it's very difficult in this profession but that's hardest thing I found hard. Keep explaining my circumstances."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I am severely hindered by both patients and staff, who don't seem to understand anything on purpose. Poor."
"Care/ Treatment","I wouldn't it helped me, but I was disappointed that they wouldn't assess my medication. My doctor has recently changed it and I'm feeling better. I just wished they could have done the same."

"Access to Services","Faster access to CBT"
"Access to Services","Have more funding available to give people with mental health problems a choice to get them out mixing with other people to rehabilitate them quicker. It looks like the funding is not available and cutting back will cost more in the longer period of time."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Employ a legitimate psychiatrist. Sack Dr X, Dr, X, and X for writing false diagnosis reports."
"Access to Services","To have more mental health units like Millbrook, they seem extremely kind and caring in anything. All the doctors. Psychiatrists, nurses, cares and professional cleaners and other staff in the dining room."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some of the HCA's are very patronising and rude. To feel safer.  Whilst on Orchid ward I felt that my safety and that of others was put in danger due to a heroin addict bringing drugs and needles onto the ward. He would also enter the female bay at night."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff to take more time listening to you when you want to chat to them."
"Access to Services","Earlier intervention. In my case I was basically left to my own devices for too many ears."
"Access to Services","To have more voice groups a week maybe twice a week."
"Environment/Facilities","Install better cycle stands. The present one risks damage to bicycle front wheels."
"Care/ Treatment","Maybe create a group within the service for people to meet if they have the same condition in a supervised environment (if they want to)"
"Communication","Wish knew it before."
"Communication","All other services are poor. I have complained but it has made no difference."
"Access to Services","I think that more of these groups are needed and funding is vital."
"Access to Services","More funding and services for mental health patients."
"Communication","More support for me would be 'more support' for loved one and early intervention reducing longer term care. GP's being made more aware of carer's and their role in the whole of society."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I wish they had more staff and resources to be able to visit more often. I coped fine with the time that I had, but a more frequent visit would be beneficial to all. They need a bigger budget!"
"Communication","Staff must always listen to the patients about their condition to enable to be given a good pathway to recovery."
"Communication","More information on all aspects of the mental health service."

"Access to Services","Funding so this group can continue. To pay a belly dance teacher."
"Access to Services","Have more sessions with Rosehips."

"Access to Services","Dance group in Newark area."
"Environment/Facilities","The provision of information about carer support at an early stage,"
"Communication","It would make things much easier if CPNs had work mobiles and gave the number to patients. One of my CPNs cancelled a lot of appointments when pregnant and the message often was not passed on to me. When I tried to call her I could only leave messages with reception."
"Access to Services","Keeping appointments on time. 10.00 appointment does not mean 11.15. The doctor is always 1 hour + late in seeing us. Buy her a clock."

"Care/ Treatment","More people to talk to us so we are not left alone just to sit around all day."
"Access to Services","Be twice a week for the company."
"Access to Services","The only reason we put 'good' instead of 'excellent' is that the CST course only lasted 14 weeks. Mum has loved it and it seems to have done her good, but the good effects probably won't last unless we find another way of getting this type of stimulation for her."
"Access to Services","I appreciate that eventually there comes a time when we have to move on, and you discharge my wife. I understand the reason behind it, also knowing that I can get in touch if need be."
"Access to Services","Much quicker access to the service."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Dispense with the services of Dr X. She made my wife's condition much worse and failed to diagnose her condition. Has she heard of Lewybody dementia???"
"Access to Services","To investigate problems I had been experiencing so that it could have come to an end much sooner. My mental health and physical. Health has been damaged severely also my existance."
"Communication","Improving communications between the various NHS departments involved."
"Access to Services","That I was aware of the support earlier when I was actively supporting my mum. Being that my mum is self-funding I found there didn't seem to be the same support for her / us as a resident funded by the local authority."
"Access to Services","Lack of respite places and resources for under 60's or groups in Nottingham."

"Care/ Treatment","Twice promissed appointment in 6 wks, no appointment came so twice I had to phone back after 7 weeks to ask about appointment, then had to wait a further 6 weeks so diagnosis took over 6 months instead of 3. This is after first appointment wait of 3 months. 9 Months wait."
"Access to Services","Good service if they stick to the times they have given."
"Access to Services","Provide the service for longer. Give at least 2 weeks notice of termination of the service."
"Communication","Some items took a while to understand. The requests for information to be sent to family members to prevent both confusion and some distress due to not fully understanding what is happening. Overall ok."
"Care/ Treatment","I am aware of the financial limitations of the service but I feel, although 12 weeks appears adequate in some cases, a more flexible time limit could be in operation. We are not all the same asI have been informed, I have a history that needs exploring."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not seeing different people and staff. Want to see the same member."
"Access to Services","Time of visits."
"Safety","Staff to sort the patients that are bullying an individual patient."
"Care/ Treatment","Transparency!!! (Secret Hospital) To stop the practice of managers from wards at Rampton, Investigating complaints about ward staff. Most staff who work here are related by blood or marriage, doesn't bode well for impartial investigating."
"Care/ Treatment","Over reliance on custodial treatment for those who are non-dangerous suffering mental health breakdown."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to see modern Atipical tranquilisers used for people like me less side effects, better academia."
"Access to Services","More psychological therapy, more ward rounds."
"Safety","there are some good staff in Rampton buy there are others who should not be in the job to be honest - they show no respect at all towards patients who don't see things from the patients point of view. Some staff are welcoming but bullys also show so much lack of interest in the patients is firghtening how thos people are allowed to work here."
"MHA","That help should be there regarding getting back to prison when needed. I've been here five tears and should really be getting back to prison!"
"Food","Cooking"
"Care/ Treatment","More psychology."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Learning development interesting still treatment plan achieve goals?"
"Communication","Unfortunately in this service, the clinical lead (ie RC) doesn't listen to patients. He decides what he things and pays no regards to what I need or require. And furthermore staff/nurses will not disagree with the RC. Within ward rounds (CPA etc) but openly disagree  and  argue on 1 to 1 with me."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Getting more staff. Getting rid of XXXXXXXXX."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Only one? Understand that voluntary refferals who don't want the world to know about their problems should be treated as human beings. Do you know what it takes to admit and ask for help? To tell family and friends? Then to not receive any treatment after 12 weeks but get stereotyped and told that you are expected to line up every day with the smack heads because you cannot be trusted as an adult to take your medicine as directed. Obviously because I only went for free drugs not to get off them. I never knew I was a fake untrustworthy idiot. I do now."

"Access to Services","I have benefitted greatly seeing a psychotherapist over the last few months, on a weekly basis. My only disappointment with the service is that we had to wait until the students were away during the summer for this to take place, despite this, excellent support (need a dietician to compliment and enhance support)"
"Environment/Facilities","Sometimes when I'm waiting and there's lots of other people there it's a bit scary, but I don't know how you would get round that."
"Care/ Treatment","It would be nice if appointments were available at Cripps Health Centre as well as the QMC."
"Access to Services","I found it very difficult to finally get the appropriate help. I felt I was 'passed around' different parts of Nottingham Health and trying to find out myself where best to go, my G.P is good but not good understanding of mental health and eating disorders, perhaps would have been different if another G.P. If I hadn't had a supportive friend pushing me to keep seeking the right help, I'm not sure I would have got better."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Take  people more seriously. Educate the Dr's more. I knew more than they did using Google! Junior doctors are not good enough. Dr X was only availiable once all year (2013) after a complaint."
"Access to Services","My main bit of feedback about my experience would be access. The service was great once I finally found out that it was available to me but that took too long, too many different gps .

"Food","Tea and biscuits with the session."
"Access to Services","Faster treatment quicker."
"Access to Services","To actually allow my husband an appointment with the so called prison to go to discuss his scan and X-ray results, which he hasn't been given the results or prognosis for after waiting 4 months! This service at HMP Nottingham is shocking, my husband was told he had an appointment, to then be told he wasn't on the list to see the GO. He is in constant agony with 2 chipped bones having been left in his shoulder muscle by dodgy surgeons whilst he has been in her majesty's custody, and he has been left in agony without medication due to lack of communication and staff shortages. He is not getting anywhere with complaints and if this is not sorted out I will be making a firm complaint! Not good enough!"

"Access to Services","It is very frustrating to be let in the door to queue up only to find that the optician, dentist etc. is not there. This often requires us to then wait until next movement to ?? Healthcare. Matte a system in which we're told at the door, before queuing could ??"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","A better physio: Cares a bit more about patients. Maybe a second for second opinion."
"Access to Services","I went to health care, I arrived at 11, patients who were seen at 10.00 still waiting and mine got cancelled. I think this needs to be looked at."
"Environment/Facilities","The staff need to tell you more but they need the equipment to be maintained. E.C.G not been working for 2 weeks. More doctors and nurses."

"Care/ Treatment","When you are provided with treatment from one of the specialists, like physio or dentist and you are unsatisfied, reasonably, you are left lost and angry.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Night cover, crisis team is pretty dire. Also shorter times between appointments"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","No I am very happy with the service (Dr Barratt)."
"Access to Services","The closing of Day Centres for the mentally ill was a catastrophe. I still attend one, but it has had to change to a charity to gain funding. They were essential and offer a range of services located all under one roof + central."
"Care/ Treatment","To coordinate all levels of care - and sometimes to find someone who can help with health care issues when ones GP doesn't talk about mental health issues & there is no time to discuss it."
"Care/ Treatment","Better training for A & E and first responders in people who self-harm & require treatment. I have been told by a receptionist, that I was a waste of space & time when there were ill people in the queue."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","I had total 43 visit to my psychiatrist but still I am in big sleeping problems. Depression. Thank you."
"Care/ Treatment","I have lots of health issues - which can make depression worse and I may now have to move to an another area - because I can no longer maintain my home because my health is deteriorating the GPs are difficult to contact there a long wait for appointments and they do not care."
"Care/ Treatment","Overall the service I have received has been excellent, however I cannot say the same for my son. his transition from CAHMS to Adult services was inadequate & his level of care since the age of 14 has been lacking. This has impacted on my own mental health as a result."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Rough treatment from NHS mental health service many years ago and ever since even though now I am on only a psychiotric and side effect Tabs ***********"
"Care/ Treatment","The same services are now split in all directions at different venues. The care is not the same. A lot of people with mental health problems now have nowhere to go. Talk + support from people who suffer the same now is sparse + splintered."
"Access to Services","I'd like the duty system at Stonebridge from 9 am not 1 pm, i.e. if my CPN is not available in morning there is no one to talk to but out of hours there is always someone. If the crisis team had staggered shifts it would be better someone is available at all times because they're not available during "
"Communication","Sadly when I attempted to get in contact with somebody, I struggled on several occasions. Therefore I believe this is something which should be improved!"
"Access to Services","Follow up after been discharged."
"Care/ Treatment","Offer a visit on the day of crisis when referred, rather than a visit several days away. You are a crisis team and I felt worse after the initial contact, not better. Also, don't send a policeman round just because you're not willing to visit yourselves."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to meet Deaf/Hearing people as well!!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Worried about cut back on staff."
"Communication","To know what other services there are available to help me recover."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like a more gentle, staggered approach to leaving EIP. For example, reducing contact to 1 visit per month then 3 months, then 6 months before going solo with GP. GP would be there from the beginning too."
"Care/ Treatment","For the members of staff to be a bit more firm with patients who clearly are not displaying mental health issues, but behavioural issues. These patients as I have experienced are clearly rude to members of staff and order them around as they are their slaves. No one should have to put up with being treated in this manner or being threatened by patients."
"Care/ Treatment","Put wifi in the ward cos it can give the people a bit of sense of achievement to do something and it would cut the cost down of family's visit by communicating with loved ones cos each visit cost money to visit them."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I do not get to see the same doctor, therefore I feel there is no continuity."
"Care/ Treatment","More OT. Access to WIFI"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","The admin at enrolment."
"Communication","More course notes to take home and review in order to remember."
"Access to Services","This course has been very good to help me move on but it would help if we could have a follow on group  maybe 3 or 6 months on to help refresh the things we have learned."
"Access to Services","Somewhere to go after course as don't want to have our recovery come to an end."
"Access to Services","I'd like the course to have been a little longer and practice techniques more in a supportive environment (ie the course group)."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I told a member of staff I had been feeling suicidal for a period of time, but the following week I was not asked how I was. This was a big deal reaching out but was very invalidating not to be asked ho I was."
"Communication","Enrolment process made clearer - first come first served more relaxed."
"Communication","More discussion - less form filling."
"Communication","Greater depth of information."
"Access to Services","Courses to be longer"

"Access to Services","Longer sessions in group"
"Access to Services","Longer courses"
"Care/ Treatment","In absence the worker should leave the relevant information so someone else can run the course."
"Care/ Treatment","When tutors have days off the organisation should improve. Classroom needs to be bigger."
"Environment/Facilities","More resources. Classrooms are too crowded for people with mental health problems. The early sessions were difficult for some people & I think it may have stopped them attending."
"Access to Services","Maybe choice of more courses."
"Access to Services","A longer course"
"Access to Services","It might be good to have a review after maybe 3 months or 6 months, to see if we are still practising all we have learned, and may be refresh what we know."
"Access to Services","12 month review?"
"Access to Services","I am now an outpatient and meet with my local Community Mental Health team every 3 months to check everything is ok. I believe I am a success story from EIP and it saddens me to see the cutbacks now in place."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More support."
"Access to Services","More time - more groups get more GPs involved let them sit in on group work to see its not all in our heads that we do real physical problems not just an over-active imagination This is important to so many of us with mental and physical problems."
"Care/ Treatment","My CPN just did ***** drop offs and I needed to talk about my health my CPN then decided to discharge me and I couldn't  understand  how she came to the conclusion that I did not need help any more."
"Access to Services","Often felt really bad during day. Crisis are not available. Day workers do not often have time to listen. Just need someone to talk to other than family."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Patients may need help to argue there case to come of ***."
"Communication","The system in place to cover for CPN absence, notify me of  absence  leading to cancellation of appointment."
"Access to Services","This section could do with being a lot bigger, for many years I was discouraged from having any therapy or alternative treatment to medication. I was told there was a 2 year waiting list and they wouldn't put me on the waiting list, even though I'd had depression several times for over 7 years from being 18 years old, it took seeing several doctors and changing medical practices before I was eventually put on a waiting list. I've been on several waiting lists that have taken too long, I've spoken to lots of people that have not seemed to understand depression and anxiety that well and have not been that empathetic/sympathetic, I have been let down lots of times by being told that I'm going to receive a particular type of therapy/see a psychiatrist etc and then this not happening, a lot more advice and support needs to be provided, there needs to be more funding, mental health needs to be treated on a par with physical health in terms of funding/priority/targets/understanding on the impact it has on someone and their life, people need better support earlier on, the whole system/approach needs to be improved. Employ people who have experience of the conditions, more mindfulness courses."
"Access to Services","Throughout 2014 I was able to access courses on recovery via the recovey college. This improved my mental well being  but students are limited to 3 terms so I do not have a replacement."
"Access to Services","More Time"
"Environment/Facilities","Ensure the hot water boiler always works so we can have tea and coffee"
"Care/ Treatment","Improve planning, esp. in time allocated for course sessions, so that 'rushing' through segments is avoided. For example, these feedback forms being given out (and completed) interrupted the session/course I had attended for."
"Communication","Poor communication regarding medication/collection dates and delivery, ""really poor""."
"Communication","Need to take more notice of me."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff."
"MHA","Jasmine suite, Custody suite. Angels, be honest. Call a prison what it is. then I can have my rights. My day in consultation with a solicitor."
"Care/ Treatment","No night time doctor available. No food except biscuits. No sharps to ???????. Door to bedroom closed/not locked but closed. No access to mobile phone. No respect from night staff. Lack of confidentiality between police and staff. No medical checks. "
"Care/ Treatment","Waiting for prescriptions."

"Environment/Facilities","""The day room, we spend all day in the dining room because the day room is dark and off putting""."
"Food","Portions of food."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing levels alone very poor on the ward at the time they was only 4 members of staff for 24 patient, and I was wait hours for a 121 when I needed to talk to someone. At the time I did not even get to talk to someone when I need it the most and I felt that if they talked I would not of needed PRN."
"Involvement","Everything about my personal care. My input about my  care. What meds I'm prescribed an agreed care plan and not just one I'm put on."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Previous experiences have been terrible due to the patronising and dismissive attitude of other consultants."
"Care/ Treatment","I think that when seeing a Psychiatrist a little more time for the appointment could be allowed. Feel rushed sometimes. "
"Communication","Maybe a resource pack or directory about support & services in the community."
"Care/ Treatment","More appointments with profesionals."
"Communication","More co-ordination between neurological, psychological and psychiatric departments who are at the same hospital. More local appointments. Greater support during a crisis from people I know."
"Access to Services","More groups are needed in the towns & city of this area for existing service users to get together."
"Access to Services","People like me with enduring Mental ill health need the structure of professionally run Occupational Therapy which has disappeared due to Financial Cuts."
"Access to Services","I've been left without a care plan, just ctisis team number if i need it."
"Communication","My experience at Millbrook was totally different to the experience at Bassetlaw. I feel that Millbrook did not listen to my views or have any concern for myself. The treatment that my husband received was rushed and they seemed to want to discharge as quickly as possible. Consultant was very rude to me."
"Communication","I felt that I was being patronised and my concerns were not taken seriously, which made me feel stupid. So an improvement in that department would be helpful."
"Care/ Treatment","For me, less forcing on medication."
"Access to Services","I would have liked to have been offered more alternative therapies as part of my treatment."
"Access to Services","I feel let down and disappointed by the whole experience right from seeing my GP to never being called back afterwards."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I thought that X X the Social Worker pushed me in doing things the job went to her head attitude not good."
"Communication","I and I know others do not know what telephone no to phone if crises outside office hours the system seems too rely on people you to A+E which is frightening and take hours to see somebody gather that our local crises team is moving premises and being improved I and other friends who have my condition have no idea what this is nor very ***** telephone nos I have been on psychiatric wards many times there needs to be more half way homes for helping people not to go into wards + to help them when they come out before go home."
"Care/ Treatment","I didn't like it when X X and Dr X told me to wait in the waiting room when them two were talking about me."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think over the last year I have been seen by three different Psychiatrists. Continuity of care when you feel rock bottom is very important. I did begin to feel abandoned + paranoid that they all left."
"Care/ Treatment","I think people with Mental Health problems need more help with different therapies not just medication."
"Access to Services","I tried every way I could to get support. I got nothing till Dr Medley agreed to see me."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Keep same Dr. Do not change, listen more to patient needs. Quicker appointments."
"Record Keeping","Lost my records + meds card. Took a few days to sort out. Caused distress."
"Access to Services","More check-ups more often."
"Communication","More information, more local groups."
"Care/ Treatment","Not with my psychiatrist but I do feel as a service that if you have multiple problems it cannot deal with you. The adult service is designed for people with a simple diagnosis."
"Care/ Treatment","Shorter times to see the Psychiatrist. (Every 2-3 months)"
"Care/ Treatment","When you are classed as bipolar - the GPs tend to look at this and nothing else - and so miss other diagnosis."
"Care/ Treatment","New checking in and out system. I don't like it, I feel like I am on formal observation when it's my own time."
"Communication","You listen to what I say."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel ignored and disrespected with regards to my insulin usage. To have blood sugar readings running at 12.8 on waking and  being told 'they're fine' horrifies me. Then to be told I couldn't have insulin to bring it down made me extremely anxious. Then I was allowed 4 units which would bring the 12.8 readings down to approx 5mmol. Therefore I could have no breakfast and was left hungry due to a doctors lack of knowledge of diabetes & carbohydrate counting. I know this will continue until a doctor from the diabetic team explains."
"Communication","People listening to me."
"Environment/Facilities","Bedding changed each day. Food provided at night (eg sandwiches). This is important as patients have to take medication and it would line their stomachs."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Members of nursing team to be given time to talking to patients (one to one) this is in addition to talks/time requested by patients. A 20 minute talk/discussion to be mandatory each week."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff to be available for 1-1 care and support."
"Care/ Treatment","More activities!! Art Therapy."
"Care/ Treatment","2nd opinions from 2nd community nurse whether or not I really had to be brought back to ward."
"Access to Services","I've had a really bad past 12 months couldn't get appointment when I've needed it."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Very prejudiced. Did not listen. I did not actually need help. I felt as though the person was talking to me about someone else. I stopped the medication by my own decision, against the practitioners advice, and felt no difference."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Being with the same person instead of frequent changes. There seems to be no progression in my treatment towards a resolution."
"Care/ Treatment","Medication."
"Communication","Mental Health Services and GP to work together better. There is no communication between them."

"Access to Services","There are insufficient support from key workers such as Social Workers, CPN's, Councellors and weekly support groups."
"Access to Services","Was told at my last visit to physhyatrist that I would be contacted to have some anxiety councelling but this has not happened."
"Access to Services","When I initially sorted myself to have the courage to ask for help it took a while for a contact and then I had several visits from different people. We were not getting anywhere so I made my thoughts known. "
"Access to Services","Yes, it would be nice to have a support worker, again, or someone who understand's my need's."
"Communication","Listen to and trust the patient. Trust with respect."
"Access to Services","I cannot get to see the GP I trust. Havent seen her for 18 months."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have no support outside my Psychiatrist and GP. This leaves me feeling anxious, mentally and physically unwell."
"Care/ Treatment","I keep asking for Linda to get more help or change of meds. Nothing has happened. Promised to liase with GP. Not happened."
"Access to Services","Would change to positive GP is not helpful but when my self-harm increased I was given a crisis team no- which I already had & they couldn't help. No body knows how to help me I feel hurt/very alone."
"Care/ Treatment","Would *** kept seeing me, recommending unnecessary medication and talking with pre-judged prejudice, instead of finding out who I am if I had not stopped coming + could be *** someone ***"
"Access to Services","I hope that I will be able to continue being cared for by the same M/H team for as long as I need it."
"Access to Services","I have just started to go to mind, for support. Because I was just left to defend myself in life on my own, (since 2011.) with mental health problems."
"Communication","Better communication also listening to try and understand mental health problems. Try to help us (ie groups, therapies, etc). Be more understanding and make us comfortable when seeing psychiatrists instead of making us feel uncomfortable, and have social workers you can trust, instead of letting you down."
"Care/ Treatment","More meditation CDs (relaxation)."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Better advice."
"Care/ Treatment","To be seen on time."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The service is a shambles They are only interested in keeping the number of people on their books down."

"Care/ Treatment","I have personality disorders, and have had care, therapy refused due to this."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I would like to have a NHS worker or key worker. This was stopped about 9 months ago. Due to me wanting not to go to a gym or swimming? Nothing else was offered appropriate to my like or trust."

"Communication","More notice when changes are to be made. I find change hard to deal with. It causes me anxiety."
"Care/ Treatment","More staff working in this field and particularly in schools treating young people earlier before they cause harm to themselves and others."
"Care/ Treatment","My contact with the service has been inconsistent and this has caused my symptoms to worsen at times. It's not always clear who I should be contacting & what my long-term plan is. Things are also very slow moving at times and contact with my GP has been poor."
"Care/ Treatment","Patient confidentiality I was discharged & told to come back when I didn't have the illness that is causing my depression. I rang crisis in desperation. Nobody would speak to me. I was passed from pillar to post & information was never passed on so *** I did was go over the same things. I was left sitting in the waiting room for 1/2 hour as reception didn't inform people that I had arrived. I got a phone call asking why I hadn't gone to an appointment. I never got a letter!! I waited 3 months for an on ward *** only to find out that I had been discharged Nobody even had the decency to tell me."
"Care/ Treatment","Referrals to Macmillan House have been v disappointing - I have suffered pain and suffering for 25 years due to rapid pressurisation in chamber whilst training to work in 5 bar atmosphere - no department in primary or secondary care seems to understand effects nor willing to pursue a pathway to be able to recognise my symptoms!!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Same Psychiatrist a CPN assigned to me."
"Access to Services","The follow-up, administration, organisation appears to be in crisis - very, very poor."
"Access to Services","Very slow referral process. Tick box mentality of some practitioners. Rushcliffe mental health - different trainee every session - waste of everyone's time."
"Access to Services","Yes - there definitely needs to be more time allocated to seeing a Psychiatrist, once every 6 months is absolutely ridiculous. I should be seen by a Psychiatrist at least every 3 months if only for prescribing new medications."
"Communication","Yes, knowledge of 12 step addiction programs."
"Record Keeping","From other medical treatment by private outsourced health services, managed by NHS and NHS *** audited my Care Quality Commission for over 4 1/2 years. I have no confidence in realising proper/competent outcomes from this or other such surveys. Since you will not ascertain a true picture how patients are treated nor levels of care!!"
"Access to Services","I am desperate for help but there is none. *** been alienated by the service. INSIGHT were brilliant. I needed long term help from them but *** only allowed 10 session For a service that deals with vulnerable people they are a disgrace &  incompetent. I don't trust them & they are unprofessional PLEASE HELP ME"
"Care/ Treatment","I feel that I have not been given enough time to explain my situation. I feel I am not being taken seriously at all."

"Communication","These questions do not appear to have been designed to find out the impact on me of the poor service I have experienced."

"Communication","Better relationships between staff & patients."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","For there to be more staff. So patients with leave can get out."
"Care/ Treatment","I felt like the unit was very chaotic and I didn't get much time with staff because there was always an incident to be dealing with. I feel like I've had to discharge myself without getting the help I need because the staff aren't available."

"Access to Services","When already heavily involved with CAMHS the CAMHS worker in a much better position, even over the phone to undertake a risk assessment to prevent wasting time or hospital bed."
"Communication","Listening to my views as well."
"Communication","Going to my GP about my wife. I don't think he took my view into account."
"Access to Services","I realise resources are scarce, but cannot emphasise enough how much of a difference they made. CPN's visits were enough to keep a very volatile situations much calmer and infinitely better for both parents. To enable my father to go on caring for my mum, a continued monthly or two monthly check-up visit would have been wonderful. (He was able to express his worries, talk about how he felt ask advice about all manner of things). This time spent with a professional, caring CPN was crucial to keep the situation stable and would have been a good way to continue into the future."

"Privacy and Dignity","Male and females in separate wards"
"Access to Services","Since my dad got diagnosed with dementia we haven't had hardly any help from any services. We have only had some input once dad got admitted to queens but then he was sectioned which was such a shock to us as we've been asking for help. Dads been in since beg of October and we still haven't heard anything from social services. We feel very isolated as a family and feel that all the dementia friends adverts we haven't had anything."
"Care/ Treatment","Ensuring that patients aren't left to sit in their own faeces"

"Access to Services","It would be good if something like the cognitive stimulation therapy for Dementia could be provided for longer than 7 weeks - even if it was only once a week and we had to pay."
"Access to Services","As mentioned above the courses at the hospital are very good, but for the other part of the year there was no other contact from anybody other than a 10 minute appointment at the GP once a year (medication review)."
"Access to Services","Assistance in continuing with this sort of support. Left to families who work full time and struggle to maintain stimulating therapy. Person loses momentum when clinic stops."
"Access to Services","Day hospital to be seen regularly by designated nurse was often who called away meaning my seeing her was for short time or not at all."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","For a long time in the morning as we waited for everyone to arrive; and after that, for a while, every one just sat and did nothing except speak to people next to them, if they could speak. I thought of all the things I could be doing at home instead of sitting doing nothing! I will be glad, and my husband will be glad for me to be taken to the hospital in the future when I am very ill and when I cannot speak or do anything."
"Care/ Treatment","I attended St Frances Day Centre for two reasons but felt I was not ready for this type of programme and I was fearful of the future. Someone from NHS contacting people like myself would be a great help."

"Access to Services","No comment, but would love to go on another session at St Francis Hospital."
"Access to Services","Now I do a lot of things every day. Very early morning I go for a long walk most days, up hills and round fields. At home I do a lot of cooking for ourselves and others. I am happy at home now every day. I enjoy art and gardening and music. Eventually I was very sick, each night after being at the hospital. A doctor came to see me in the second night + gave me pills. I was discharged from going to St Frances Day Hospital on 30/10/2014. I hope to be taken back again in the future ***."

"Access to Services","To be able to keep in touch with support workers after discharge from services."
"Access to Services","To keep the service going."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Need advice"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Continuity - having the same person coming to see you each day instead of someone different each day."
"Access to Services","To keep the IRIS team as a permanent rather than temporary package of care - just because it is  a multi-faceted team and so one phone call accesses a range of services. Having a key worker overseeing the whole care package is of great advantage he/she ought to be retained whilst a care package is needed."
"Access to Services","A CLINIC AT BASSETLAW HOSPITAL WORKSOP WOULD BE HELPFUL!"
"Food","FOR THE STAFF AT A&E TO GIVE YOU A DRINK OF WATER."

"Access to Services","I would have liked a few more sessions. there are things that were nor resolved."
"Access to Services","Quicker treatment. It has took 6+ months and numerous referrals until the right service was established for me, now I am on a waiting list for CBT psychotherapy, it could be 9 - 12+ months until I start. For someone with mental health issues this is far too long to get help, and mine is quite hard to my physical health too."
"Access to Services","The time it took from being accepted for therapy to the time I started therapy was too long due to the waiting list. Maybe more therapists should be employed so patients don't have to wait so long."

"Access to Services","The length of time it takes to get help. Not crucial in my case"

"Care/ Treatment","I was on metazapine a medication which prison don't want me on. Mental health decided I needed treating. They promised me if I came off and went on ??? it would make me better and if it didn't they would change them. I changed meds and now they say I don't need treating even when I'm complaining of them making me worse which they are. all they wanted to do is take me off metazapine and not to help me. I find this disgusting plus just lost son and watched my mother kill someone."
"Communication","I would help MH to get the prison more involved (ie AIC). The support is never there from AIC."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Stop treating prisoners at HMP Wakefield like zombies on a locked ward - we are high functioning men. Get healthcare reps that actually kick ass. Get a mental health daycare unit. Develop services for men locked up 22 hours a day."

"Communication","Try and improve your communication with family carers, learn how to complete appropriate care plans. Above all try to treat patients as people and conduct yourself in the same way that you would like to be treated."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The trust needs to implement its policies ie. Those policies that state that the patient is at the heart of the service...policies that talk about involvement with patients and carers etc. our family has received the most terrible attitude from some of the staff on this ward for example my brother's key worker, calling him sinister whilst he was in the room! Being rude and aggressive to me. Why??? I am assuming because staff like this know that they can say what they want and nobody will challenge them. Involvement...well there has been none at all. The same key worker dreamt up a care plan on his own and using inaccurate notes...all it was was a list of potential violence indicators. Not one shred written about my brother's needs. I asked the ward to complete a proper care plan, involving my brother and family. Well apparently it has been revised.....but still nobody involved my brother or family. We haven't even seen what is in it! The trust needs to take on board criticisms and act on them, instead of dismissing concerns out of hand and just talking about what it does well."

Perhaps could be helped with free parking? Otherwise nothing else. (car parking also takes a long time - not helpful if you are anxious."
"Environment/Facilities","To make the waiting room more inviting.  Provide a drinks machine and more magazines.
More publicity to make people aware of the service you provide as I had not heard about it until referred from school.
It is difficult to get parked sometimes within the hospital so an alternative meeting point would be beneficial to a lot of people."

"Communication","My worker spent more time writing things down than talking or coming up with different strategies. very off putting when someone writes everything down and you have to wait for them to put it down before you can continue with the ""conversation"". "
"Care/ Treatment","Generally service excellent, responsive and helpful. However felt that once maintenance weight achieved some more focussed support/advice would have been helpful. Person with ED initially encouraged to eat/put on weight, then advised to reduce weight leads to confusion/conflict for person with ED."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The move down to maintenance calories could have been more supportive. Providing more consistent. CBT."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Generally improve some of the staffs attitudes. Give us patients respect and don't demand it off us all the time. A less patronising attitude by staff is needed and would generally improve the over all service, no one like being talked down to. Some member of staff listen but others hear you but don't listen. But improvement needed. More improvement needed by some members of staff. As patients we are not always involved with our own care, its a case of do it because you need to tick a box. Some of the therapies can take too long, like a course over 12 weeks when it could be done in half that time. Access to the doctor needs more improvement.

"Involvement","I would have chose a different path or been given more options. Services won't let me go back to home town to visit family by myself or escorting even they are no restrictions in place. Sometimes they will tell us how its going to be without consulting us only to revise their decision afterwards. Where I am at present is more relax. I have been on tablet meds for best part of 12 years without incidents, it took 9 months for them to put me on a depot because they did not have the infrastructure to do so. Taking away choice in administering tablets for depot. Not giving more choice in accommodation in the community."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Teach the staff the manifesto as they should follow peers to do.

Incorrect feedback goes to ward-round due to in reference to Rio which should be regularly checked as it is not fair or ethical to patients. They accuse me for animosity and causing trouble on the ward - which I ask examples of but they can't answer. Everyone has their own preferences, only I believe that my current consultant isn't very professional. Unfairly judging me for the atmosphere and trouble on the ward and this is consistent.

Appointments (e.g. with solicitor) are not always communicated to me quickly and I don't find out until later, or until they turn up. This isn't the staff's fault it's the NHS.

Again, they always tell me what's happening and why they think it should happen. But rarely take any notice of how/why it will affect me!. Peoples idea of respect is somewhat questionable in Rampton. But there are some very respectful. I beleive there is significally room for improvement. They tell me what they want very well and repeat it often. They only listen to themselves and no-one else.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","A lot. Treat us like proper C----'s. No one listens/bar one actually The rest just pretend to care/ its just a job to pay the bills. They don't really care, its what ever is easier for them and you may think I have something against Rampton but I don't. I came here hoping to get better and open mind but you have bad apples. They just turn everything around on you. since being here I have been treated with such hostility from almost every nursing staff etc on my ward. I feel like we ""us patients"" are treated so unfairly all the time and spoken to with such disrespect and patronised on a daily basis. Because whatever you say, they respond with ""that's fair enough but we are going to do it this way anyway!"""
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff. I would prefer to go back to prison. Rampton is like a prison not a hospital. My care/treatment has been very poor.  I've spent 3 and half year there and still don't have a diagnosis. Lack of communication is an issue. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Employ more staff on the wards as at the moment it is rubbish. Messages are not always passed on to the patients. Some staff don't care if you move on or not. Sometimes you don't get to say about what care/treatment you get."
"Care/ Treatment","More privilages e.g incentive earned privilages"
"Food","Come into line with Broadmoor/Ashworth. Supper i.e toast etc, better prices in the shop. We need more ward base activities i.e card making, model kits, structured sessions, more ward based projects (transition ward). D.V.D player on the ward as in 7 months only 1 DVD night has happened.  Staff shortages is no good for moral, updated game consoles, game consoles in bedrooms, better MP3s.  Room cleans as it's not uncommon to expect to wait 3 weeks.  Closeting chains on out of grounds escorts + not high risk cuffs. I feel a lot of decisions are made without patient input. "
"Care/ Treatment","Games consoles in rooms PS4 and Xbox 1 for communal used like Broadmoor More Mp3s  DVD players.
"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing levels could be better. Sometimes restrictions seem too harsh"
"Care/ Treatment","More whole ward activity."
"Food","Food"
"Care/ Treatment","More therapeutic sessions More creative wards More colourful environments. Day to day thing/problems  Name nurse sessions. Again more consistancy and understanding. Could do more to show they understand. Take to long to get answers back. Consistancy would help. 50/50. By speed in which decisions are made and carried out after a decision has been made"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some staff do not care they ooze contempt and can be utterly disrespectful.  When complaints are made about this and it's known to be true, do not cover and hide it (change it).  It is minimised and undermines therapeutic intervention."
"Communication","Questionnaires"
"Communication","Obviously there are things you can't discuss with me and then its frustrating."
"Communication","Management listening to patients views not putting budgets before everything else eventually you need to say no more and we are there. Although staff (ward/psychology) listen to patients it makes no difference at management level. Messages are not passed on, on occasions Messages between departments are often confusing and differing, patients opinions are rarely taken into consideration by management. Staff at least listen to your view. Lack of staffing means ward and psychology struggle to do their job properly"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing wards properly"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I feel more staff would be good at times so sessions are not cancelled and more activities are in place"
"Communication","More involvement by managers. Seeing consultants on a more regular basis."
"Safety","Staff watch out for people who play mind games. Take it seriously. Speak for us, don't want to be intimidated."
"Safety","Microphones in the security-cameras too, to help protect patients and staff more, from any badness on both sides. Sometimes the staff/doctors do things in our care or treatment without letting us know. Sometimes, yes. Sometimes very not. Usually I'm involved fully. Sometimes not."
"Care/ Treatment","Women's service could do with more of the above as classes often clash - need more options to get a full timetable.  Staff - the movement of staff without consultation of staff, breaks up teams and severs therapeutic relationships with patients - low levels of staff - has great impact on the quality of services offered e.g. cancelled classes and lack of activities on ward e.g. no ward walk and no singletons also no access to library and shopping days.  The low staffing numbers also stress staff out making them bad tempered and demoralised."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Ward staff showing empathy and listen more to patients involving patients more in there care pathway. Majority of the time the staff show no compassion and say nasty comments to upset you. Especially in M.D.T meetings the Team don't involve me in decisions and plans and they don't even listen to my account. A lot of staff don't understand people's distress and don't show empathy."
"Leave","More off ward sessions but more staff needed for this. They don't follow care plan. I feel the staff let me down when it's to do with physical things."
"Care/ Treatment","Understanding each individual + their specific needs."
"Leave","10 hours fresh air a week as states in policy have a bigger selection of healthy food at functions and fairs/events always cake and pop crisps chocolate no fruit except at female friends. Staff are good at listening but don't act on what I tell them. Staff don't talk to me much. Because I feel like in my experience staff spend a lot of time chatting to each other about holidays ward staff. They tell me what they are doing but not what they want to see from me or guide me. Because we constantly sit in rooms looking at each other not all the time and it is improving with sapphire gardens and 1pm to 2pm walk."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff"
"Communication","Take complaints seriously."
"Communication","The staff have never really listened to me. I told the truth. They only listen to what they want to listen to. "
"Care/ Treatment","I feel their needs to be more aware of E.D in younger girl and women at Rampton instead of the osbitty crisis as well. I feel there needs to be a step down when peers have near their stay to move on. They could help me more with my E.D which I feel they don't help me with."
"Care/ Treatment","Stop segregation. Forced medication. Not enough fresh air.  Not allowed to rest. They force medication on you. Treated badly, unfairly. Forced to take medication. Not enough gym, menu poor, not allowed to rest."
"Care/ Treatment","Consistency. Sometimes choices are taken out of our hands."

"Communication","Give contact details (name & phone number) after the first/initial assessment. I didn't know who to contact (if I need some help/advice) prior to the next appointment."
"Access to Services","Making things happen sooner. Time is very precious when dealing with someone with mental health."

"Access to Services","Speed up the waiting time between the initial assessment and the treatment."
"Access to Services","Making appointments at closer venues, as some patients cannot travel for longer distances. ""I'm happy for a home visit by X"""
"Communication","Have used the healthcare for some time and feel they don't care about us. They don't care or listen to us. They need to listen and treat us as a real person. It takes weeks to get a response, then the treatment is very poor. They don't care. They think everything is a lie. They don't see us as a real person just as a prisoner. Again they think we are lying. They do what's easier not what's right. I've been asking for help from mental health for over a year not still feeling the same."

"Access to Services","It takes too long to access the CAMHS service. Real cases are time-lined on attached sheet. Young people cannot wait three quarters of a year before accessing CAMHS support, especially in life threatening situations.

"Access to Services","Have a shorter waiting list. We were referred in Dec 2014 and are still waiting for treatment (Nov 2015).

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Re-train old staff? in caring and empathy. Some staff just don't have any at all, maybe think we are scum, I think of some of the staff who have been here a while where re-interviewed prob would not get a job here                                          "

"Communication","The first few days in hospital could be improved, very frightening and wanted information about facilities, times, who people were etc - just general reassurances.

"Access to Services","It took quite a long time before I was contacted for social inclusion.  It also took six months from seeing the first psychiatrist to the one i am seeing now."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Due to my age, gender and race, I realise that I am in the high risk category.  I did see a good psycholigist [Dr Leader] at St Annes House, who recommended an appointment with The Community Assessment Team.  Upon receiving an appointment a month later, I travelled quite a journey, 4 different buses in all.  The Community Healthcare Professional arrived late, then asked me to describe how I felt?

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Help with benefits and housing."
"Communication","Letter reports can sometimes take time."
"Care/ Treatment","As above, can all of the mental health nurses who have no idea or understanding of the word empathy and use the money saved to provide much greater access to clinical psychologists who can actually help. The numerous mental health nurses I have seen are arrogant, disinterested individuals who quite clearly have an ego complex. We need you guys to stop finding so many idiotic mental health nurses who are only interested in a power trip and an ego boost and start providing more psychologists to help people better cope with the root.  A basic level of respect would be a breath of fresh air. What almost no-one working in MH seems to understand is how easy it is to say the words without an understanding of the impact this will have on the patient who has to live and breathe their problems."
"Communication","Communication and listening skills. I was visited once by a so called professional from the MHT. I was then told there was nothing they could do for me so they never bothered to contact me again. The mental health has since deteriorated since their one and only visit."
"Access to Services","My name is Calvin Singleton. I have had to wait 12 months for treatment with the help of my MP. We question why I was having to wait so long. We ask this in July 15 and still have not had an answer. This is rubbish and needs to change."
"Care/ Treatment","I would like more home visits, feel more secure."
"Access to Services","Would have liked more contact with the CPN as I had only just met and found it hard to open up to her about my situation as I have trust issues."
"Communication","Actually listen to service users and not automatically dismiss them base upon their diagnosis. "
"Communication","The care given by the support workers sent by the crisis team (not the nurses). They are nice poeple  but a lot of the time I felt that they did not listen properly. One even said I was a mystery to him. Another on at least 2 separate occasions, failed to pass on information that led to a missed appointment and distress caused to myself because he failed to mention I had a particularly tough day coming up. I had some really bad days and support workers seem to brush over these, unwilling to discuss them, but clinging on to the tiniest positive. I have been discharged twice by the Crisis Team even though I was expressing suicidal feelings. The first time I was left with no support. I attempted suicide after both discharges. They need more money!!!"
"Care/ Treatment","Would like to go out more and make more friends but don't know how. "
"Physical Health","I hope my King Mill appointment to make me feel better with my heart etc.."
"Smoking","Give people who smoke a place where they can do so at any time. It is their wish/destiny not yours."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","You can employ the right kind of staff, the existing staff are ??irrelevant? and not caring and not adequate in their approach in identifying patients's needs or care or the patient's illness.
You made a mess of everything, you were supposed to do right."

"Food","Cook
Burgers dry hard
Burgers burned"
"Food","Food: Patients complain about food 4 patients out of 14 came for lunch today some were with disappointed with what was on offer of the appearance of the food."
"Food","Food - sometimes the food provided is lacking nutrients . The amount available is fine, although as a raw vegan I find that basic whole foodstuffs such as nuts and seeds can be a little weak or missing altogether. Also the fruit offered is extremely weak and unappetising to say the least. I suggest a rise in food quality across the NHS as a remedy to combat depression, anxiety and other common neuroses."
"Food","Food is a big disappointment to me. The meals is dated and need a complete overhaul. Too much carbs, no enough healthy options, or options like if first choice has ran out we have to do with 2nd which I might not like. Things need to be made with fresh ingredients."
"Food","The food is not nice as patients are preferring to order from takeaways than eat from the trolley. Patients complain but nothing happens. The food is try or burned. Not edible. Very disappointed."
"Environment/Facilities","Wi-Fi should be available to all.  this sis so unacceptable that you should pay compensation for not including Wi-Fi in the care package."
"Smoking","You could be a bit more ?appreciating? on what people want to do. Most of us want to smoke a lot..."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","One Dr in particular was very rude and derogatory - all Drs need to handle patients with care, respective, smpathy and sensitively not agressively."
"Access to Services","Difficult to access talking therapies initially took too long."
"Access to Services","I should meet often the member of mental health, once a 3/4 months is not enough.  I have been told that next one is the last."
"Access to Services","You could take more interest in what is going on in my life, check to see if I am coping well."
"Environment/Facilities","Television"
"Access to Services","Response could be faster & larger amounts of free services be allowed everywhere. For services to go on for longer"
"Access to Services","A longer course, not so intense."
"Food","Maybe a kitchen for people who cant afford to buy although the drinks machine is a nice price and people can bring their own lunch.  "
"Food","The break between the morning course and the ones in the afternoon, isn't long enough. I feel like I'm rushing my dinner."
"Access to Services","Improve courses in an ongoing way. Offer more courses. Offer something for the service user who would like something more intensive."
"Care/ Treatment","Keep trying to improve the service, even though you're already great."
"Communication","To be more organised and aware when sending students timetables, with clashes of courses. The courses could be 6 weeks as they feel rushed in 5 weeks."
"Environment/Facilities","More technology, ie computer."
"Access to Services","Make classes longer."
"Access to Services","Offer longer courses."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","We would benefit better with one teacher, which for me would be more focusing/grounding for the course."

"Access to Services","Make courses longer."
"Access to Services","Courses too short. Just scratches the surface of a subject."
"Access to Services","I feel I could have had more info/discussion about choosing the courses in the first place. There has been lots of information since but I think a more in-depth discussion would have helped me make better decisions at the start."
"Access to Services","Slightly more time for courses so learning isn't rushed. This term was 5 weeks istead of 6. 6-8 weeks better."
"Environment/Facilities","Wheelchair user - need to be pushed to toilet. (xfe'd from Best Thing).
Nothing - very welcoming."
"Record Keeping","Remove ethnic slur (""gypsy"" underlined) from form, if thats all right."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Nottingham Recovery College."
"Access to Services","Make the courses longer."

"Care/ Treatment","Link the courses to therapy.
Spend less time on admin.

"
"Environment/Facilities","Better resources in the room eg smart board."
"Access to Services","More courses end term."
"Access to Services","Re-thinking how long/how people access the college. How about giving people a number of tokens to spend on the college as all the courses are ??? their will help ?? the ???

Feedback - need feedback make a ??? ?? to after the course to see how effective the course ??? long-term."
"Care/ Treatment","Make sure 6 week courses stay at 6 weeks rather being reduced to 5 weeks even if means there's a break."
"Environment/Facilities","Larger rooms with better IT resources eg, Smartboard, or even a Whiteboard."
"Environment/Facilities","Larger room."
"Access to Services","Disappointed that the recovery college course was not 6 weeks due to the Easter bank holiday."
"Access to Services","Maybe longer courses."
"Access to Services","More time for courses so learning isn't rushed."
"Care/ Treatment","Perhaps create a link between the teaching courses and therapy."
"Access to Services","Extend to areas outside Nottm City, such as: Newark, Mansfield the coutryside location."

"Environment/Facilities","More technology."
"Communication","Information on who to contact in a crisis, more access to CON."
"Care/ Treatment","I did not like the way my assessment was carried out at Highbury Vale. It did not seem genuine. Also I feel patients should be given a disability assessment."
"Access to Services","Speed of services and more treatments available."
"Care/ Treatment","Specific therapies or techniques designed for people with Aspergers.  Help or advice about therapists it was when my NHS treatment ended."
"Care/ Treatment","I have multiple sclerosis and did believe that whilst being admitted in the hospital I didnt fully understand my needs."
"Access to Services","I feel that my mood has stabalised to some extend but worry about what will happen to me if my mood worsens now I am no longer receiving care."
"Care/ Treatment","More homework that makes me focus on getting better and thinking about my feelings/thoughts towards things/people etc."
"Access to Services","More regular contact, eating disorders not being hidden in the positive magazine, there are hardly any articles, not having my feedback called good, acknowledged.  Parking (I have to leave the car 15 minutes away."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Reliability and time keeping of staff."
"Access to Services","I was very unwell initially, I eventually got a bed in cygnet in Harrogate - it was horrendous, I have reported the hospital  to the CQC and made a formal complaint to the hospital.

I have needed to go into hospital since but have been told no beds, crisis only offered over the phone support so my parents were left to cope with no after 5 support, very upsetting for all."
"Access to Services","Seen by doctors quicker. Being listened to about medication."
"Smoking","The night I stopped was fine until I was told no for a fag.  After they let me ring mum to bring some."
"Communication","Listen to friends advice & think about family - take advice. "
"Environment/Facilities","Easier access would help."
"Access to Services","This service (mental health) should be given as an option to all cancer patients.  I also had EMDR treatment which has been wonderful."
"Access to Services","My opportunity to see a psychologist was held back for 6 mts - I was told medication was important to my health and was then told that medicine will not help me!??? I feel I was dischraged from services way too soon. I wished that I was still supported by them."
"Care/ Treatment","The crisis team were awful, I would NEVER go to them again."
"Access to Services","They could send my CPN back.  Having someone to talk to is important but I have no one at the moment, I have not seen her for 6 months. I have a CPN come see me every month.  She doesn't come now I'm waiting to see a doctor at hospital. My CPN understood me and knew me well, she was nice I trusted her.  :  Everythime someone new gets involved, I have to live my past again, its like going around in circles, knowing when your starting or stopping."
"Environment/Facilities","Hospital care, lack of cleanliness, lack of support, too many  individuals involved and not enough one to one."
"Care/ Treatment","Contact with my sister! and seeing the chropodist once a month, again!!"
"Care/ Treatment","More counselling/talking therapy, less medication."
"Care/ Treatment","More involvement in NHS of the therapies behind the hearing voices network."
"Safety","Increase the number of single rooms, so that feel safe during night."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I had an ""alteration"" with one of the nurses, when I was trying to contact  a caring friend, x had the grace to try contact them after this disagreement however, he did not wait to check if this was successful or not!!! it was not. "
"Environment/Facilities","Cleaning the loos more often."
"Privacy and Dignity","If a 15 minute time could be set aside to 1-2-1 with one of the staff(privately) it would be nice. "
"Environment/Facilities","There should be individual bedrooms for everybody."
"Care/ Treatment","To give me a fob and a key to the art cupboard.  "
"Leave","More leave, greater communication when on leave."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It was more like ***, they were mental with observational sheets all the time, following you around like a POW in yhour own country.  They were always on the computers to the detriment of care.  M"
"Access to Services","See CPN as often as I used to."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Psychiatrist should have been quicker to go outside of the area for advice re referral to gynecology sooner."
"Care/ Treatment","The crisis team is not brilliant, it is actually quite poor in my experience and left me feeling worse than before I phoned them. A service to help people get back into work and supporting carers for those with mental health problems would be very useful."
"Care/ Treatment","The crisis team are a waste of time. They treat your diagnosis not you. The support they offer is poor and not individualised and minimal."
"Communication","Sometimes GP plus mental health not reading off same page, feel a bit lost in the middle."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Having the same doctor would help, I hate to see a new doctor as it feels they don't know me."
"Access to Services","I have had three different diagnosis over 5 years by 3 seperate psychiatrists. This has confused me. Medical help is available but been waiting for a very long time for therapy."
"Communication","More communication between healthcare team, psch/Gps/patient.  When a proff eg psych is running late for appointments, better communication.Bad, mental health in general!  Too many healthcare professionals being lost or not replaced, putting greater strain on the service.  :  I would be interested in the outcome and what improvements can be made following a survey like this!!!"
"Physical Health","Physical health needs to be monitored as well as mental health."
"Care/ Treatment","Joined up approach before offered talking therapy - having to pay for this. I am lost really.  People think you get help but you dont really."
"Care/ Treatment","Join up the ""disjointed"" service.  Great gaps between being passed from one team to another, with no indication of how long to expect to wait.  I am a single mum of 3 (also have mental health needs) working full time, some sort of authoritsed ""respite"" break from work would be a valuable in put in place some simple theraputic time eg, walking, gardening etc."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some employees in mental health services are extremely good, though you do come across the bad and, rarely the diabolical! I am referring to experiences of being patronised and pushed to do activities I was not able or ready to do."
"Privacy and Dignity","On one occasion seeing a member of the crisis team, I was invited to an appt. It was a male member of staff whom I had not met before and was in an isolated room. Due to previous sexual abuse I had already stated my preference to see female workers only and this was agreed on my notes."
"Communication","Sometimes the crisis team dont understand what you are going through. They need to listen more."
"Access to Services","More funding for young adults in the mental health service."
"Care/ Treatment","I was under the crisis team, sometimes it was hard to go over all my details when a member of the team came and they hadn't read my case notes."
"Care/ Treatment","That you dont have to have too many cancelled sessions at home - I was told 3 and ended up with 20. It was continuous trauma recalling the same upsetting story. I would say a maximum of ten-12 sessions is enough.  Keep to a team of no more than 5 support workers - I saw too many, it prolonged my recovery I am sure of this."
"Care/ Treatment","I was advised to take Mirtazipine which made me feel suicidal more so, I explained to the Crisis Team it was making me worse they told me to continue, they did not listen.  I later took an overdose which could have been prevented, also false promises about time scales."
"Communication","I felt sometimes, because of how I present myself and I manage my home well this made me appear to be a lot better than I was actually feeling."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The one area I was struggling with which caused my breakdown could not be sorted and is still ongoing. I really think that there needs to be more help for mums with children who have emotional problems. There was no support in this area for me. I have tried for two years to get him diagnosed and nothing has happened and still needs help."
"Care/ Treatment","I have had a number of medicines, not all of them worked."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not to judge on looks or how well you are dressed and assume you're ok. To support and not lecture. To show some understanding and care!"
"Care/ Treatment","Get rid of early intervention psychosis team, save NHS money. Now I'm desperately seeking GP as I am getting worse."
"Communication","Time to respond to phone calls and a duty system from 9am not 12pm."
"Care/ Treatment","Letting people receive the correct medicine prescriptions instead of receiving the wrong information."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Seeing main psychiatrist as discussed, not being dismissed so casually when not advised or ready.  Having my expectations managed, knowing of a follow up, next steps for treatments.  Tone of the letter(s) received, GP options. The junior psychiatrist said his boss was more than happy to see me and treat me then being dismissed seemingly altogether. Communication break down being told one thing in person, then having opposite in writing, then it changing again in talking, but not written down to confirm."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I don't find the crisis team helpful. There is not enough help in an urgent crisis. A&E staff very discriminatory if go there for self harm/overdoses. Major bed shortage (if need to be admitted)."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The rate in which the consultants I had changed so frequently that at times the continuity was broken. I therefore found I had to repad certain information."
"Care/ Treatment","The mini course that I have had so far was largely irrelevant. I felt that it was a waste of resources and I could have had more benefit from starting different treatment straight away."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The nursing staff were far too busy. They must be very stressed themselves. There needs to be more staff. Also I left hospital and I feel abandoned, the crisis team didn't call"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff needed. Staff work extremely hard and really need more support."
"Care/ Treatment","Can't comment on anything negative, my care has been amazing & supportive. Happy with all care. Maybe more activities and outings."
"Food","That Bacon would be free"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","That the staff get a better deal & get paid better for their great work!"
"Environment/Facilities","Got no sink plug in bathroom, Put in Wi-Fi for mobile phones, food not bad, fitness gym - spa room, daily newspapers, cups dispenser on wall, new washing machine, shortage of shower rooms, decent pillow cases & Insides & Duvet Covers."
"Care/ Treatment","More things to do.
A gym to get your fit."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To have an on site qualified psychiatrist or psychologist or someone similar to help the patients when having difficulties and in crisis.
Staff often busy & feel you are going to be pain if needing to talk to them when it is busy."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff more nurses & more doctors.  Less time at the computers & more time with patients"
"Environment/Facilities","We could do with a new washing machine urgently and toaster for the ward."
"Care/ Treatment","More opportunities to go out on escorted leave to Morrisons etc."
"Communication","More choice and try a different way of communicating, more understanding."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More nurses and Doctors has I was getting better."
"Access to Services","Times between appointments is too long."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","My new psychiatrist looking up my notes, before seeing me I felt a little let down and not known now. My psychiatrist I have been under for 20 years has just retired and my new psychiatrist is nice but he hasnt read my notes and knows nothing about me apart from having ECT, whilst my previous psychiatrist has booked 2 months in *** and left a message it was for a year and see how I am then."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I know that people have to learn when they are training and they move on but I feel this has affected my care as when I just start feeling I can open up and build a rappor they move on and I have to repeat everything all over again. I feel it puts me back."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I am the most upset about not even being diagnosed and receiving the right treatment for my mental illness, the last 12 months I was seeing a psychiatrist, asked him for diagnosis and i didnt get any."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, the stigma associated with mental health and more funds spent on mental health. No, a visit to the hospital mental health is not good. Tell our government to get their finger out and recognise mental health issues."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","My needs were not met holistically ! I did not receive as much support as I would have liked and my personal circumstances were not always taken into account."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Yes you never seem to see the same psychiatrist for long they move elsewhere. Then you see a different psychiatrist who alters your medication and you end up back at square one."
"Communication","Better communication. Mental health and GPs. Better training of GPs about mental health issues. I would prefer not to be passed about to different professionals and having to go through everything every time. Better involvement of carers with professionals."
"Care/ Treatment","I present myself in a good and tidy manner and feel because of this it is not perceived that i have a mental problem.  Also, I had and have a weight problem since taking medication but no program to assist in reducing this."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Yes, the same doctor not seing different ones. I would like to see the same doctor and not keep on seeing different ones as I am not a people person and have to come out of my comfort zone."
"Access to Services","At my lowelst point I wanted to be admitted to Millbrook but there was no places available which I found even more distressing."
"Access to Services","Waiting times are too long when you state your in crisis and need help as soon as possible - it is difficult to see your own psychiatrist and have enough time to discuss everything. The Crisis Team at Millbrook could be more alert and informed and attentive than they are at the moment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Out of hours service quick response but not always sympathetic."
"Access to Services","The accommodation and staff care in Enwright. Close Newark from Sept 2013 to February 2014 was very helpful in my recovery from my mental health problems, sadly this facility is no longer available to others."
"Access to Services","I saw my doctor on 5th January 2015 because I felt so bad (depression/anxiety) and he referred me to the psychiatrist! Did not get an appointment until 3 months later, since 2nd April two appointments have been cancelled by the psychiatrist.  I was assessed for distress management but this was unsuitable because half the  course dealt with anger management and other inappropriate things. Since the psychiatrist wants to change my pills but that hasnt happened because she cancelled the appointment.  My appointment is still two weeks away, I am frightened. I was assessed by a pshyc assistant, but nothing has happened."
"Access to Services","Its difficult to say, not when the condition changes and my mental perception is altered it is quite hard to know what to say - I have had periods of time when I have been very depressed and lost and overwhelmed by my condition.  I think that the gaps between appointments have been hard and  I have had contact in periods of crisis but when it isnt  and at no point I felt that there isnt the support with just getting back into life - when life is very complicated with having needs for care and providing care to others - its hard to get support."
"Communication","Improve communications with wider health care professionals (eg GP)."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Employ more staff. Provide psychiatric beds."
"Access to Services","The classes could be longer and over longer length of time."
"Access to Services","There is not enough beds for urgent admissions.  Sometime patients have to go outside our area for a bed often away from normal help, friends and carers."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More one to one with councillor as  somethings are too depressing to discuss in groups."
"Communication","How ones brain works after having brain surgery for epilepsy instead of getting help from friends that has CP."
"Care/ Treatment","More structure could be given as in a rehabilitation setting many people dont feel able to mix and often there are more staff  than clients which can be daunting when you are new to the situation only."
"Access to Services","They closed mind at Kirkby so I don't see many of my friends."
"Access to Services","The NHS has supported me to the best ability.  I think waiting times is long winded to see a professional person, all doctors want to do is give tables, I cant fault the NHS."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More empathy, by all staff."
"Communication","When I transferred from one psychiatrist to another, I had to personally chase up the trasfer despite my GP writing a letter for transfer."
"Access to Services","Access to crisis team and out of hours care, I have tried to use this 3 times and every time I have failed to obtain support."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Maybe some help when it comes to what foods to eat or an exercise plan.  Some like that, that could be monitored online."
"Communication","Need to listen to problems and not think right I'm running out of time to read the paperwork to the patient."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Increase in salary for staff
without this service death rates would increase. "
"Care/ Treatment","Only, more groups/sessions to help people."
"Care/ Treatment","Instead of 1-to-1 which I first received I fell groups should be offered first."
"Care/ Treatment","Wish I had got to know others a bit better."
"Environment/Facilities","To have meetings in a room that doesn't smell or have stains on the carpet."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","When you had them come to visit you or had to go and see them, try to stick to the same people instead of a new set of people all of the time."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Crisis care is inconsistent. People agree actions and then do not do what they say. My MHT do not follow up/check on me after an out of hours crisis event when I am at high risk of taking my own life. People can be judgmental and don't want to understand what you are going through. Cuts in hospital beds have left people very vulnerable. Cuts to services mean that you often have to wait for the support you need which leaves you very vulnerable. Training for staff should include service user input."
"Access to Services","Waiting list for specialist (step 4) psychotherapy."
"Care/ Treatment","Told me to do it myself, how can I when I dont understand how you feel yourself. Went for 8 weeks, just had to do the work myself. I had anxiety for years, no understanding all they did was print some paperwork out. Just seen them for 5-10 minutes in a room and then told me to phone someone up and they refused treatment."
"Access to Services","Faster route to supported individual therapy."
"Access to Services","Its a matter of finances - not about the care offered. Not enough staff for them to carry out the work effectively. My psychotherapist stopped by finances against my psychiatrists and care teams expressed wish."
"Access to Services","Protection from Government cuts and along with social workers, a higher status from society via our sensationalist press."
"Access to Services","More groups with people in same position."
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, empathy would be good. I am a highly educated person and not stupid but the counselling appears to be aimed at the emotionally and intellectually deficient person. Total waste of time. I feel I am just ""ticking boxes"". Counselling very impersonal - all done via ""handouts"" and signposting to u-tube.
"
"Communication","Transition from CAMHS to adult services, disjointed, lack of communication between the two services."
"Access to Services","Although not a great thing to happen, I have managed to see another on the team who seems ok.  Tried getting support from Nottingham City and it was awful."
"Involvement","I think that side effects of the medication should be discussed more with service users."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Consultant."
"Care/ Treatment","Communication between phone conversation and getting action ie appointments."
"Access to Services","There could be more accesible places to be treated for mental health. For example I have been going to the specialist depression service over in Mapperly which is miles from Beeston!Sometimes I didn't understand what my pshycologist was talking about - talked in too much of an academic way!"
"Access to Services","Appointments in the evening to support patients who are in full time employment."
"Communication","More frequent access if required. Communication. Listen! to patients for the so called professionals to be a lot less condescending!"
"Access to Services","Each time I have been referred to NHS mental health services by my GP, the wait to receive treatment has been far too long (this time 7 months)."
"Environment/Facilities","There is a rule on TV about music I think this shouldn't be there.

Moving on."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Treat me with more respect, as staff were at times extremely rude to me. Thorneywood inpatient was no help to me, and when I was transferred to a more secure unit they handled it really badly."
"Communication","You could start to make staff directly accountable where it is proven that unfounded and untrue statements are made about patients and families of patients. You could start to deal with complaints in a timely manner and train your PALS team to deal more sympathetically with complaints. Also make them directly accountable for their actions and inactions. What the Trust does very well, is self publicity, minimising the level of complaints and dismissing complaints out of hand. The complaints process is designed to wear people down, so that they give up. It is also designed to add to injury suffered for those who dare to complain. Nothing is ever admitted and so no member of staff is ever held to account. People with genuine complaints or with appoint of view different to the trust is viewed as a trouble maker and not thinking in a persons best interests."
"Care/ Treatment","That someone actually does something productive for once in their existence."
"Care/ Treatment","Make appointments start on time.  Better communication from reception staff to concerned family & friends. "
"Communication","Give the young people a chance to talk, Show more respect, listen when we talk."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To have a consistent Doctor. My son never had same Dr for meds review and finds it hard to connect with strangers."
"Access to Services","Really difficult but maybe a duty team at night. It is often the most stressful time. We always end up in A&E it can be extremely stressful."
"Access to Services","Very good today. In past - large gap between my daughter's last CAHMS appt & next appt"
"Access to Services","Maybe come & see me more often to catch up with things & see how I am"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Be around all day."
"Access to Services","I think they could improve on having CAMS 24/7 instead of office hours."
"Access to Services","Maybe have CAMHS 24/7."
"Communication","Explain about other people with similar issue."
"Environment/Facilities","Provide chocolate <smillie face>. Seriously though, wi-fi etc would have been nice, not important."
"Care/ Treatment","Maybe if I had something I could hold whilst in the room to calm my nerves."
"Access to Services","To get a bed a bit quicker (QMC)"
"Environment/Facilities","More gym equipment."
"Access to Services","More like them out where I live."
"Care/ Treatment","The care taken to make a transition from childrens services to adults services should be better. I was left without any care for over half a year whilst I was transitioned. Medication reviews should be more in depth and take into account the patients opinions on treatment."
"Communication","Make the work easier to understand."
"Access to Services","Long Waiting times for treatments and appointments "
"Access to Services","Less of a waiting list when waiting to see someone"
"Access to Services","It took a long time for mental health services to take me seriously - it also took 6 months just to arrange an appointment because of missed cause and lack of communication. I had to rush through CBT due to turning 18, then relapsed and nearly got to the point of suicide, then I was taken seriously by the Crisis Team."
"Access to Services","React faster to people who need help."
"Access to Services","Contact seemed to lessen after a couple of days, family were aware of the plan. The main phone number very often went unanswered."
"Access to Services","Just to be there if we need them again."
"Smoking","Would like to smoke on ward. More freedom to do things. Feel like they don't consider my point of view."
"Environment/Facilities","Games console in my bedroom."
"Access to Services","Waiting lists."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting lists for community accommodations."
"Care/ Treatment","Sky TV.
More trips & days out"

"Care/ Treatment","Have guidelines for the rules & policy instead of law."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More freedom & fresh air."

More leave"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time with staff"

"Access to Services","The group could run longer"
"Food","The way in which meals are dished onto plates."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff needed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff on duty. Weekend activities would be nice."
"Record Keeping","Don't expect staff to have time to see to patient's needs properly when they have to waste time with unnecessary useless paperwork. Filed but not of any use at all."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Better ?caring? with Doctors."
"Food","A cafeteria."
"Access to Services","Extend the service. I know finance is always a problem but some may come from other sources of employing outside help."
"Access to Services","Longer clinic time, as appointment can feel rushed."
"Communication","Listen more to carers needs and health problems and help solve situations. Emotions need more attention.  Discuss feelings of carers & patients.  Don't ask questions about weekly progress.  Give more confidence to both cares & patients."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff and resources for the unit."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time with patient , plus."
"Privacy and Dignity","I would have liked the opportunity to speak to someone without my mother present.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I do think it is important to keep this service going and replace staff that leave. Please don't let this service diminish."
"Food","Cook the Jacket potatoes thoroughly - still raw. Natural yoghurt. Dry bread, for sandwiches vegetables overcooked. Our complaints are about the quality of the food served. "
"Food","Could be a lot better if they saw us as people. Just like themselves. They deal with their customers giving plenty of choice, Listen to what they have asked for. They are also treated with respect. Sometimes I have wanted to leave the dining room because of poor treatment by cafeteria staff and choice given. Patients could go down to the cafeteria. More choice. Less stress on nursing staff. Too much of their time is taken up serving meals. They also have to keep going down stairs, when food not cooked."
"Care/ Treatment","The staff could be free at meal times and do the nursing, that they want to do. Could be more nurses."
"Care/ Treatment","Be allowed to go off ward more often."
"Access to Services","Follow- up support. It's also a shame there was no opportunity for a intensive interview as the patient and carer together and separably in addiction to the carer's pack it would be very useful to have lots of advice about how to handle dementia patients."
"Access to Services","Better aftercare services as demential isnt going to be cured/improve patients shouldnt be signed off after being discharged."
"Care/ Treatment","More emphasis on the news session"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have the same member of staff not keep changing them. I build a relationship with staff. When i have a different member of staff it takes time to bond. I feel as i got worse if they change staff i will be reluctant to engage. I may not respond to then.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Don't keep changing the doctors."
"Access to Services","Visit more often"

"Safety","I have been teased a little bit."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There is only 1 qualified nurse on duty at night."
"Access to Services","I would like to walk each day, have a nurse to talk to every day - show empathy, ask how you feel and assure about what is happening to you. I would like structured, planned time with medical professionals. I would like the service to be more tailored to the individual."
"Food","Food could be better."
"Care/ Treatment","Difficult having people with different conditions together. People should try a different route if possible."
"Access to Services","I live in Keyworth and have previously been in Highbury. I find it difficult being so far from home."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Help with personal care/washing is poor.  Have someone in charge.  Food could be better.  Staff could tell the truth and not defend each other.  Pull chords to request assistance."
"Food","The food is OK but limited"
"Communication","There isn't always someone available to help or explain what is happening or what I need to do."
"Care/ Treatment","Take you out a bit more."
"Access to Services","I go to Francis Day Unit on a Tuesday to Alzimers meet but due to lack of funds there will be no more meeting. This is bad as we are meet and find it very good and well being. It will be missed very much. Please do something. Thank you."
"Communication","General medicine/service communication with mental health services as no one knows why you are there and do not have shared records. Very unhelpful to care provision."

"Care/ Treatment","Time management."
"Care/ Treatment","Increased social support."
"Communication","It would help if all the different departments communicated between each other. "
"Access to Services","See patients quicker."

"Care/ Treatment","Better understanding and help before admittance to hospital."
"Communication","Seeing people and chatting."

This is a minor point as far as I can tell, communications with my mother were very good for the most part. I refer to an incident where mum was told her hearing aids needs cleaning - so mum took it upon herself to clean them in water - and thus ruined them."

Stop stupid mind games by staff members (not all staff). No consistency with staff approaching.  Seclusion is used for the wrong reason and should be a last resort. Feel it is a punishment. Don't listen to what you have to say. Talk at you not with you. Asking you to go into meetings doesn't mean you are involved. Made me feel so much worse, not better, wish i had never come. "

Updating computer/games consoles.
Treatment pathways to have times and involve gatekeepers at an early stage, as it seems like patients are sitting around for course and movies to RSUs delayed. "

"Care/ Treatment","Create more things about recovery. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff levels. "

People don't listen. No one really takes what you say seriously. People don't really communicate with me they are just more focused on punishing patients. People don't respect my views and opinions in my care pathway. People talk about me behind my back. Staff want me to feel humiliated."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff could work 2 split 12 hr shifts. Pts sedated on Clozaril. Patients sleeping 24/7. Staff talk amongst themselves. Staff are rude. They do what they want. Not enough exercise. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Day and night staff working 2 split shifts. 8am to 8.30pm (days). 8pm to 8.30am (nights). Need more health and fitness like gym/swim/walks/sports hall etc. The work areas are victorian. More emphasis should be placed on psychological treatment.

Staff work too long should have 2 12 1/2 hour shifts 8am - 8pm start 8.30am finish - 8.30 finish. CPAs should be 6 monthly planning meetings then get your CPA doc to you by 2 weeks after. I was given the ""Rampton Treatment"" ""the hard way or the really hard way"". They don't include Pts comments on the CPA doc. Not enough: fresh air, fitness, food."
"Care/ Treatment","Have more variety of activities on and off the ward."
"Privacy and Dignity","Rampton is the worst hospital for females, we get noting, unlike the men. I think people in hospital should work to earn their money. Stop patients getting hurt. Ward rounds every month should be every other week. Lonf wait to see a Doctor, should be possible when I need one. I have to wait to go to the toilet after breakfast, I should be able to go before."

Some of my team/staff disrespect me, especially when restrained.

"Access to Services","I found difficulty accessing the (smoking cessation) services initially. I couldn't find appointment times/clinic times on-line so phoned the helpline to enquire. I then had to see my GP to refer me to the clinic who then referred me back to my GP for prescriptions. It should be easier to make quitting easier."
"Communication","Being able to talk to an adviser at any time."
"Access to Services","Be able to guarantee ongoing care in the future."
"Access to Services","This help I have received should have been at the beginning of 1988.  The support I had at home was what I should have received years agol."

"Access to Services","We wouldn't have to wait so long on the wait list to get a regular appt. slot"
"Care/ Treatment","Trainee with more confidence sounded like a leaflet or textbook. 
Kept fidgeting.
"
"Access to Services","The service was excellent, only thing I would like to see change is not putting a limit on how long you need the service/help. Everyone deals with their problems differently and need the help longer. It can put pressure on that person and added stress."
"Access to Services","Reduce waiting time before therapy starts."
"Communication","Maybe just help with networking, finding groups etc."
"Privacy and Dignity","Female ppsychologist should be available on request."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I ask could I keep on seeing [Rick ] but they could not because of funding since then I have just been getting by with help from my friend [Adrian]  :  I was seeing [Rick  at posibie at Mary Potter Health Centre, I was thinking I was getting somewhere then they stop getting funded and cant see me no more and I have got worse and I found him a great help."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes. Dealings with crisis team was very very chaotic, saw at least 10 different people (plus different ones on phone). Most had not read any notes and most did not have any knowledge about previous questions I asked. I live by myself, and have never asked to be admitted, one day I rang 3 times and asked to be admited. Totally ignored. No visit and no one rang to check on me. Spent approx 3 days lying on my floor. It was very unsafe and I decided that at best the team was unsafe. I spoke eventually to a friend who is a GP, she took me to my Drs, spoke up for me and got my medication sorted. I would not be here without her."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I dont have a care plan or ongoing support.  I feel very left down by the whole service.  If you dont make a fuss and tru to cope by yourself you basically get dropped.  I dont feel supported at all."
"Access to Services","Timescales - limiting everyone to the same amount of sessions. We are all different."
"Access to Services","I have asked for help with my mental health over 20 years.  It has taken attempts on my life to finally received the help that I needed.  More early intervention would have improved the quality of life."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything"
"Environment/Facilities","Issues arise because of working practices within prison. Namely: things take too long and do not work properly. "
"Access to Services","Quicker appointments for dentists and doctors."
"Care/ Treatment","Would only recommend the mental health service here to prisoners. You's could see prisoners for longer and not just ask the same questions each time you come. Also, could act interested. Don't think they have done anything that has made a difference. Don't seem interested, get the impression they want to go, as if they don't know what to say to me. Ain't really done anything for me."
"Access to Services","Here in H.M.P Wakefeild Prison the service could be made better by making it quicker to speak with a mental health worker when we need to not 7 days later."

"Communication","Staff from Nottinghamshire (say?) nothing, unlike Wakefield staff that just tell me that I'm wasting their time and just need to talk to someone."
"Communication","Inform patients if the service cancels an appointment, even if it's on the day of the appt. Informing patients of any follow-ups."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more mental Health workers in case some are unwell and cannot attend. Weather is an important meeting for me or not as in this world every little help when your unwell."

"Access to Services","Problem in my case (PTSD) is waiting a longtime for diagnosis from military specialist base in Nottingham shire otherwise a very positive experience. "

"Access to Services","My 4 year old son has a speech delay.  I originally asked for help with his speech when he was 2.5 years old.  He is now 4 years and 8 months.  In that time he has been assessed 3 times and received only one 6 week block of therapy.  He was reassessed in September and I was told that he needed more therapy.  We are still waiting for an appointment despite him being described as a 'priority'.  Also, we did not receive a clinic letter from his last assessment and his school received no communication either."

Throw NHS 1986 born XXX."
"Care/ Treatment","Please could you not use emotional blackmail to revoke my section 17.  I rang police under distress from my delusions and needed fresh air and ever since then my phone has been revoked.  I have family abroad who i need to speak to as they are in distress. 
I have apologized so much about me calling the police bu my phone privileges have still been remove, my only way my family can visit me is via the phone.  Other patients are allowed family visits why can't I?"
"Care/ Treatment","Please do not take away phone privileges for patients with family abroad, it causes distress from both patient and family."

Don't diagnosis me with something then not want to help.  If you read my condition on the NHS website it tells you treatment, this what you have turned me down for"

"Access to Services","More support should be available at home for the patient and the family in a crisis, rather than automatic in-patient admission."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Need more time to cover material. 
Better guidance to help fill in Central College forms to save time. "

"Access to Services","Longer"

However, just one occasion when I was expecting them no one turned up. Approx 1 hr later they phoned to say they came but went to my home address instead of my daughter's. Obviously it was just an oversight but at the time with my mental fragile state it felt a really huge problem. What didn't help was the lady was quite sharp with me because I wasn't at home. Please be aware patients may be staying with relatives and check. Thank you."

"Leave","Allow more roaming around other wards. Allow smoking whilst visiting wards or moving about on the courtyard because it is only feedback from a small facility. The service I am currently receiving is of all good because there is plenty of walking in the courtyard. They spend most of their time in the office and it takes overtly hard work from yourself to get a decision from these nurses. It takes hard work from yourself to get things moving."

I repeatedly stated that I am suffering daily to be told ""no one is suffering"", then looking over my shoulder and saying ""next please"". Just not willing to listen as I had already been diagnosed with migraine by a specialist instead saying ""I don't need to check your record, don't tell me how to do my job"".

One enrollment form for all coursed in a term, not a form to fill in for each course.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have liked more time to share personal experiences."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I think there is a lot of information to take in each week that can be a little mind boggling.  Maybe a bit more practical exercises, very simple things though, nothing intense. 
I think there should be other help offered at the end of the groups for those still needing help or at least some guidance to have to get more help. 
The groups even tho helped me a little I feel they maybe better for people with slightly above normal anxiety & depression not severe anxiety etc.  "

"Access to Services","I was discharge before I was ready to leave due to me turning eighteen.  I feel a service up to 25 would be good as going into an adult unit is scary."

Better links with sensory ??? or partnership with pediatric team."
"Communication","Better communication between staff.
Appointments are late."
"Access to Services","Appointments are sometimes late and we get a reduced session."
"Communication","The only improvement I could think of is with regards to the initial/final questionnaire.  I felt the categories of: always, often, sometimes, and never were a little limiting.  Perhaps encompass a wider range of responses, eve if just for older patients eg adolescents. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Reduce waiting times or assess needs better - waited nearly a year for support & then support worker left.  child deteriorated & was re-assessed(those people then left) & eventually received 6 sessions of counselling. 
Keep on provisional lists/after-care needed as my son has really been struggling & my doctor is unhappy with CAMH's actions.
More consistency re: team involved as this is very poor & especially hare for young children.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff & 1-2-1's.

"Food","Serve meals on time. Treat patients with more care and understanding. Listen to patients but i do understand the staff shortages.

"
"Care/ Treatment","It would be nice to have easier access to the outside.  I would prefer a quieter environment.  I am not use to having TV on all day and external noise from vehicles and sirens, vehicles reversing is disturbing. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Xxxx & Xxxx these two nothing.  They were perfect.  the lesser score reflects my doubts/worries about the rest of the service (currently part of an investigation.)"
"Communication","Being more 'Joined-Up' with GP of patient/client (though that's more the GP informing Iris than Vice Versa)."
"Access to Services","Longer time to be involved (3 month service)"
"Access to Services","Sometime tricky to get in touch with via phone."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","After the IRIS team had arranged for long term carers to visit my dad they did the handover.  According to the info the new team received in the handover there were some vital elements missing therefore the handover could have been done better however I am aware that it could have been the new team who got the info in the handover and them 'forget' it."

"Care/ Treatment","To make the prompting and observation of taking mediation a high priority."
"Communication","Maybe give written notes about what was discussed a patient might not recall all the facts. "
"Communication","All correspondence should be sent to me. This did not happen, despite my frequent requests. I did not feel the reception staff were concerned about this.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Provide more staff so the at the waiting time is eased. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Xxx told us that we should let the DVLA know about his illness then had to send him licence away which was very distressing.  On the next meeting Xxx told my husband that he could apply to get his licence back but I could not go through all that upset again knowing that he is not well enough to drive.  I  felt that was the only thing that was incorrect. "

 Some staff twist my words."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have to sit in day room all day because of lack of staff."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Take away night time confinement.  More social events.  More staff. I don't think I have had enough involvement in my case.  Could be better - understanding."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, more time spent with doctor to build a relationship.  More nurses & NA's as we have difficulties getting to functions.  Difficulty building therapeutic relationships. 
Need more contact with doctor, more regularly than once per month - different ways of doing CPA's. Some staff you cannot talk to. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff/patient integration.
Staff do deliver on services such as program & meal times.  The way you are treated is like you are less.
Respect: could show you more respect by treating you more as equals. "
"Care/ Treatment","More structured day e.g. work & benefits.  More integration of different directorates.  Social events for all. "
"Communication","More up to date furniture.
Better communication.
Respect: depending on staff. "
"Smoking","Bring back smoking so people could relax and not teel under pressure all the time and allow patients to have take-aways on the weekends.
I feel like a piece of cattle in this place - I feel like a number. 
The food here is disgusting and the NHS should be ashamed of itself for feeding us this Xxx"
"Leave","Give bigger proportion and more bread out!!!! most definite I find the seclusion meals are ten times bigger. 
Don't listen to us.  
Involving in decisions in /treatment: Don't happen!
Positive difference to health & well being: Don't happen!"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff on the ward.
Less waste of food.
A mechanics course as I am interested.  "
"Care/ Treatment","More me on quicker.
Own room."
"Safety","We could halt the abuse both physical and chemical abuse that is regular in MHT. I had my head bashed against the wall by staff. Staff are stubborn + abusive in the guise of care. Staff tend to dictate and are verbally abusive + swear. Doctors do not comply with regulation, I do not consent. It has all made a negative difference it being MHT."
"Food","I have one issue with the food. For the patients who's not Muslim they get on the menu 5 smoked porkchop, 2 pork steak, and a gammon steak every 4 weeks. But for the patients who's Muslim we don't get any beefsteak, lambsteak. Not fair."
"Care/ Treatment","Employ more staff so activities on and off ward don't get cancelled.  "
"Communication","More listeners.  Explain how the hospital works this verbal to patients. Too few staff.  Very poor at times the hospital, repeated cancellations. The behavior of staff was lowered due to shortage of staff. Unhappy with transfer from Firs to Burne following provocative behavior, denial of medical fact.  "

"Care/ Treatment","Get patients moved to lesser security quicker than at present. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff so off ward activities are not cancelled. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything.  Keeping people to long & not enough to do with our time. 
Little or no say in treatment in some cases.  
Some bullying and racism is common place. 
I feel I did it myself with medication. 
Meaningful activities"
"Involvement","Involving decisions about care/treatment: Don't always talk to me pre CPA & after. "
"Food","Meals not good, more meat, more choice in ????"
"Care/ Treatment","Community twice a week not 3 times.  Provide more sports outside.  
For all wards cricket/football.  Use gym on the ward.  More education classes (English, maths). should show more respect, patients for staff and staff for patients. 
Involving in decision about care/treatment: I think I am on too much meds, I have side effects - I want info from the doctor on side effects. "
"Communication","Advertise more!  Let more people know about your service!.
A lot of people in the community can feel isolated, cut-off from society.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Keep on striving for a better service. 
It takes a long time to get a reply on issues.  
your are the last to know.
Not a good service for mental health"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I've been here 5 years and the therapy is brilliant its's changed my life - better access to fresh air, more caring staff better facility for staff to rest, as this impacts on how we are treated. It's very ??? and there a lot of bullying going on.  How some staff treat you in not really good - it's abuse. Communication needs to be improved massively. It's as if they don't care. Some are really good/others are really nasty.  Everything is rough to start with. "
"Care/ Treatment","Fast???
Treat each other better, patient & staff included. 
communicating: takes too long. Involvement: fairly poor."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff so session can run as planned.  
Listening to you:  the MDT do not give the patients a chance.
Communicating with you: No consistency with rules & no communication from staff to patients, e.g. gym is cancelled but staff told us about it 5 minutes before it is time to go. 
Involving in decision about care/treatment: doctor gives me no chance to give an opinion. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing"
"Environment/Facilities","More gym"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Give the jobs to people that really want to  help the patients, not to ex bully victims who see the job as a opportunity for pay back.90% of RC's don't listen. Most of the time I am told what people think I need to hear not what I am supposed to know. Some want to maintain an 'us & them' culture. What do I know about care & treatment? I'm just a scumbag patient who should just do as he's ordered.  Some staff went all out to make my life difficult. The practice of care was poor. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, ""cutbacks"""
"Care/ Treatment","Do less off ward activities and be realistic as too much = more cancellation, on top of staff shortages = chaos.  Let's work together and build up a better working relationship. My medical need's disabilities certainly don't get me, O.T proves to be problematic, I feel ignored and cannot see why my disabilities are left without assistance. Again my concerns are shower is very hazardous condensation , no air conditioning, no assistance with getting my game cube wire's shorten. No appointment slips, medication get's changed without you being notified, activities cancelled and you get told at last minute. Being called ""fat cripple Xxxx"" patients regularly use xenophobic words, extreme racist views and intimidation to staff & patients shouting & threatening dummy's thrown out and transference begins, mood hoover.  Dr. changes your meds without telling you. I'm still here trying and it's tougher & tougher hoping thing's will improve with a lot less support - both my name nurses are off. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would like to see more staff on the ward so we can do more activities and make some time for 1-2-1 sessions. 
Sometimes they do listen to your concerns but this is not always."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff as there's been a lot of shortages and we've gone without exercise access and to the basics such as shaving. At time staff have struggled as there wasn't enough of them to manage when times were difficult i.e. a lot of patients on ward on opps."
"Care/ Treatment","Employ more staff on ward. Have more therapeutic activities both on and off the wards.  Lack of staffing on the wards making it hard to get maned nurse sessions.  Staff don't listen to patient.  Staff can be very rude at times.  Staff, doctors, psychiatrists blame my physical health on anxiety."
"Involvement","Break silence about secretive decision making, include all team and users. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Management needs a overhaul on feedback to patients & carers.  Also on staff ??? to avoid ???.
There a lot of saying its's not my responsibility or their a shortage of staff our case loads are full. Only listen to you if it goes along with what they believe. No clear focus on my treatment needs & requirements or move on plan or consistency."
"Communication","Because you will never leave.  Don't listen, communicate.  Tell everyone your business.  "
"Food","Food, staffing & stop cancelling CRB."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","By changing the the staff and not just moving them from ward to ward when the staff do things against patient don't move them SACK them. Staff get away with anything the do against patients and its always the patients fault. Nothing getting resolved. You show the staff respect not the patients, the patients get ridiculed for talking to CQC. Its all decided by our care team what they say goes our input is totally irrelevant.  You do not make any difference to our health and wellbeing. "
"Care/ Treatment","Have an eye on progress."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staffing"
"Care/ Treatment","More meaningful activities e.g physical exercise & team sports. Treated more like adults less like kids.  More access to workshops and training programs to prepare people for eventual release into the community.  It's suppose to be about rehabilitation and recovery.
Because in this institution this place is infallible and when you have mental health problems this place will always blame any of you negativity on your condition. "
"Care/ Treatment","Give more help and activities.  Staff are always short.  Some staff listen and just don't care.  Some staff treat you like adults and some treat yo like a child. I have been here 19 months and I still don't know everything I need to do.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, activities, frequent CTM & C.P.A reviews/planning meetings.  Less blanket restrictions on ??? ??? games consoles.  Overall I don't wish to ?? the service because I think its unfair on the good staff as the bad staff issues make bigger headlines.
Some staff don't help in getting to understand structures others do my isn't 50/50 it seems the bad ones out way the good ones. With staff we have some brilliant people who do got he extra mile and some who don't really care and tell you that. Not enough communication and staff keep to may thinks secret from us.   Some staff lack knowledge and empathy."
"Communication","Provide more staff as we cannot do any activities. Provide more caring staff.  Be treated like adults.  Listen to patients more and act more appropriately. I am locked on a ward for most of the day doing nothing.  When you speak to staff they mostly don't take it on board what your saying.  They only communicate what is important to them, they don't communicate what is important to us.  Some staff are caring and respectful some others do not care. We just get told what to do and if we don't do it the we will not get out. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff on the ward"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More support for therapy and MDT - DBT sessions getting cancelled.
More staff!!
Listen to me: 50/50 they only take on board what the want too (staff)
Communicating: Reasonable at times - not as good as ??? staff levels!!!
Showing Respect:  50/50 some do some don't.
Involving in decisions about care/treatment: Saying one thing then something else."
"Care/ Treatment","All patients back on 15 minutes obs to save lives in 6 months there's been 2 suicides.
Not enough exercise. Don't listen to ??? pts. I'm still waiting for my CPA doc. When ??? they rolled me out of bed. Locked me in seclusion for nothing. Not enough choices of food on the ??? not enough gym."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Have less restrictions."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","To get family better. "
"Communication","Managers don't listen to shop floor staff.  Lack of staffing."
"Environment/Facilities","Have more facilities on site for the patients.  Better food & a new trolley to transport the food to the wards. 
At times I think staff should have listened to me a bit better (not staff fault).
Don't always listen in my ward rounds"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not likely because its not a nice place to be. Staff were very abrupt don't like to be challenged, wouldn't engage in conversations, didn't respond to attempts to start a conversation.
Wouldn't talk very sarcastic, wouldn't speak to patients, staff chatting to each other. 
Showing me respect was very poor because they locked me away in reclusion for 11 days and put me in strong and gave me finger food and that was a mistake that was rectified, rude and inconsiderate.  No one asked me about medication I have said I don't want to be on them but they said we can't afford not to have you on anything. In the first few years no fresh air at all, now we have a directorate walk/fresh 1pm to 2pm after lunch every day although that is cancelled for film afternoon and ruby/football at DRC (not good). locked me away shut me of from the world."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Open the day room and not keep us patients in our bedrooms, some patients in their rooms day in day out and all night. Management don't care that we aren't allowed to sit in the day rooms.  they should close all outdated work areas & do more modern activities.  Staff bully patients and are very rude.  Don't listen.  Not enough exercise. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Staff should work 12 half hour shifts.  Day staff 8am-8:30pm. Night staff 8pm - 8:30am.
No anger management, arson treatment or drug awareness. 
Too many middle management justifying their jobs.  Only see the doctor once a month - 12 times a year. Have been warned that if I tell my family how badly I'm treated here they will stop the visits. CPA should be planning every 6 months.  Not enough gym or fresh air access. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My daughter is locked in her room all the time. My daughter is sedated.  I have grave concerns about the people nursing my daughter at Rampton.  I have been offered no reassurances that my daughters treatment will improve.  My daughter is treated worse than an animal.  My daughter is getting worse not better. My daughter gets no fresh air and no exercise. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More choices of food.  night lock in 8pm-8am.  More gym Mon-Fri. More fresh air at the weekends.  They seem more bothered about patients having tools & working for the HSP (unpaid) than they care about psychological treatments. Very poor management, outdated ideas, women sew & knit, men do gardening.  Middle management just justify their work & none here is down to earth or cares about the patients welfare. Staff are rude, unhelpful and bully patients calling them names & pushing them around.  Don't listen to view written on CPA doc, they're not included on document.  Most of the patients are told to stay in their rooms & Communal areas are locked off."
"Communication","A couple of times I had a little bit of difficulty differentiating between the two health shop numbers online. "
"Care/ Treatment","Need to still be able to see county clients as given the wrong equipment at Boots and am dissatisfied."
"Access to Services","Not much, maybe more appointments to be available?"
"Access to Services","Quicker appointments (903same day)"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Infection control. Staff approach was dismissive and uncaring. Made me feel like I was wasting his time. Their knowledge was limited. "
"Care/ Treatment","You can give preventive hepatitis B injection. "
"Care/ Treatment","Do more activities"
"Care/ Treatment","I would like it to be that there was a bit more variety in what we do in the sessions. "
"Access to Services","Get more funding from the MOD so the waiting times for x army/ military  personnel could be cut.
saying that you should get more funding so the waiting times for everyone can be cut!."
"Access to Services","I would like the length of sessions with a professional to be extended. I have had maximum amount of sessions allowed, yet i still have issues that need to be addressed. I feel like I have been abandoned by the NHS, yet again like I have been abandoned since childhood by the NHS. I will be making a formal complaint regarding this matter, not against the professional that I saw, but about the whole system as I am not very happy at all about it."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Train more psychiatrist so the waiting times aren't so long.  ""Practitioners"" are not anyway near as effective as psychologists & I've had some very ineffective & damaging treatment in the past. "
"Access to Services","There was too long a delay to access the service. "
"Access to Services","More flexible hours."
"Communication","Some contact information on letters etc for later appointments or earlier or weekend. "
"Environment/Facilities","It would have helped slightly if there was opportunity for other sites, to reduce public transport fees. BUT only a minor comment"
"Access to Services","Only one minor comment: It may have helped if the service was available at various sites.  I personally have no income and had to take public transport at a cost of approx "
"Care/ Treatment","Be more time sensitive - although it can not be helped, being told you will have a max of 30 sessions is scary when you feel hopeless & desperate."
"Access to Services","Improve the waiting time to be seen/shortage of trained psychologists."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Understand patients needs & keep patients updated. 
Doctors could no speak English sufficiently to make themselves understood,  They had to consult the internet for diagnoses.
Because at 60 years of age one know what ales you and what doesn't. When you know whats wrong with you you don't need a doctor telling you, you have a cold when you have chest infection.
No results given MONTHS after biopsy's.
You are treated like mushrooms & kept in the dark, when you ask for help you get pushed onto someone else. 
We are not involved full stop.  No check ups, no involvement you are just given WRONG medication.
No support.
"
"Access to Services","appointments were long to wait for. 
Some mental health workers did not understand me. 
some workers don't fully discuss with me what my treatment options and plan is for my own health and well being and on odd occasion I've been dismissed by them. It feels like I have to just do what I'm told and suffer in silence, I want to be more involved and have a better understanding.   "
"Care/ Treatment","Frequent healthcare appointments fail to happen. No collection from the wing.  The high number of do not attend appointments is not solely due to inmates.  The time to see a doctor, dentist or optician always take too long and the possibility of being unable to get medical treatment either urgently or ASAP is a cause for concern among all inmates.
Duplication of appointments and the poor attitude of some healthcare staff are a problem.  
Everything is constrained by time and full disclosure is not possible and result in having to make another appointment to resolve only outstanding problems.
duplication of appointments, not being collected on wing or attending an appointment only to discover no one has the time to see you.  Some staff can be grumpy."
"Care/ Treatment","Get to the problem. I'm aware unless there is a problems that stops in group work things are not heard. "
"Care/ Treatment","Be quicker at responding to individual needs."
"Involvement","Keep on top of your profession. 
Decisions in care/treatment: Should provide all possible options. "
"Communication","To treat the patient with respect and communicate better.  General confusion over what treatment .  Never listen to my explanation about my condition.  Talking to you as if you didn't understand.  Treat you like an idiot.  No involvement regarding care of treatment plan regarding conditions.  Not doing anything to help with health, just making things worse. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff. Long waiting lists.  Takes ages to get down but one there its good. App system sometimes unreliable.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff on the prison side to help with out side escort's to reliever the pressure. 
Because of a laps in paperwork being delivered on time by offices's not healthcare. 
Due to officer shortage's it's made the care on external hospital visits poor,
"
"Care/ Treatment","More better management of medication, when arriving in prison. 
sometimes no response from applications.  "
"Communication","Spend a bit more time to listen to some of the complaints."
"Access to Services","Speed up the process in giving medication. "
"Access to Services","Waiting time."
"Environment/Facilities","A water cooler would be nice. "
"Care/ Treatment","Possibly speed up the process of handing out routine medication to reduce long queue's.  Provide paracetamol, Ibuprofen and creams as required without having to wait for appointment or fill out paperwork. 
Communicating with you: It is sometimes hard to talk and listen effectively through the plastic panel at the medication hatch.
Appointments are difficult to obtain and any changes in medication ca be a slow process.  I also had my medication stopped without warning by mistake once."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was refused to see a doctor by the senior nurse, outright. Disgusted by HMP Nottingham, to allow this to happen.  Incompetent staff, Staff were not interested in my concerns. 100% lack of respect.  
Inadequate, not fit for purpose, Fact!"
"Communication","We often miss appointments because we are not collected or let off the wings.  This causes a knock on effect!
We have to prove that we are ill and sometimes not believed. 
Involving in decisions about care/treatment: You see them, they tell you what they are going to do and we have no say in our treatment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","On my first assessment with the female mental health nurse, i found her to be both dismissive and aggressive . The second mental health nurse I found to be disinterested to such an extent he was yarning. 
When it comes to X my mental health nurse I'm unlikely to contact her so it would be better for her to send for or visit me as a matter of course."
"Access to Services","Quicker."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Listen to patients problems and deal with their needs appropriately. I have epilepsy and have put numerous applications to see the doctor which STILL hasn't happened and I got a dentist appointment on my release date, which is absurd. I wasn't seen by the emergency doctor when needed! I had been told I would be collected BUT I was not!! They (NHS prison healthcare team) DON'T seem to care one bit about our well-being. They DON'T care enough to show us respect!! Just because we are in prison it doesn't make us bad people!!! Decisions made behind our backs and we are only aware when they tell us the decisions!! I still have not seen a DR about my fits, which put me intensive care in January 2016 on a ventilator and in a coma....what if I have an Epileptic fit and fall and break my neck or bang my head?

X of your NHS healthcare team was the one who PROMISED me an EMERGENCY Dr appointment within 2 days - that was 2 weeks ago!!! Ask officer X (who was there at the time - I am X - X wing Cell X)"
"Communication","Understand people's problems more, more so in prisons. Understand more, listen more to people who are not well. "
"Care/ Treatment","Longer appointments."
"Access to Services","See people sooner, waited too long. "
"Access to Services","Waiting list could be shorter!
Substance misuse are XXXX"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Service decent but basic. "
"Care/ Treatment","More activities with the groups but it was still good and we learnt a lot from it. "
"Access to Services","Speed up the waiting list on dentist. 
Positive difference: sometimes you say stuff & it's or maybe forgotten about or miss placed. "
"Care/ Treatment","Hold drop in centers to raise awareness with regards mental health issues or any other issues so that people can raise their awareness, people will be able to identify others that may have similar issues which could also enable them to support each other at times when they may not be able to access support networks."
"Care/ Treatment","Make urgent appointment available where possible. "
"Access to Services","More time on the courses & let the people who aren't at work yet, in the prison, get the same benefits, monies as those who do, as an incentive to educate themselves.
Maybe do more exercises that educate. "
"Care/ Treatment","Treat people on pharmaceutical drugs SSRic's the same as those on Methadone.  And administer meds even if you miss the time slot according to the user info leaflet.
Seemingly my inability to be punctual should give leeway to late administration of drugs.
There's always loop holes, better communication between nurses and doctors.  
"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff to get better waiting times."
"Communication","Send the movement slips the day before the appointment no the day after."
"Access to Services","See us quicker, get back to us quicker. I have put numerous apps in and still waiting 3 months later. 
Involving in decisions about care/treatment: As a prisoner we don't get a choice in the matter. "
"Involvement","Improve the rooms, so that it's more relaxing for people, as well as cutting waiting times.
Regarding care and treatment I believe this should be done with the person also their so that they can also have a say, rather than others making a decision. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time for hospital appointments. Sometimes busy staff are pushed for time. Only problem was the podiatrist with refused to use antiseptic bandages & treatment causing extreme pain. "
"Care/ Treatment","Improve access to medication."
"Access to Services","With pain relief, paracetamol isn't always the best help. Also with opticians when there is issue in this field with appointments, inmates don't get told, like nine month for an appointment. "
"Access to Services","Reply quicker to prisons.  quicker appointments for x/rays after 1 year operation.  
The staff are not that bad but because it is in the prison, which is under staffed, it's up to people within the prison that suffer with our health with the checks to the service have to have when we need 999. When we need to see a doctor we need to see them within 24 hours as a lot of people here in this places are over 60.  Could be a lot better because of our age to get appointments. "
"Care/ Treatment","Let the carrat staff have more power & Involvement in the patients care & rehabilitation.
The prison service limit involving you in decisions about your care and treatment. "
"Food","Provided tea & coffee"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have Xxx on site more often"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More one to one time. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff"
"Care/ Treatment","More appointments"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff.
I had to wait a long time to see a CPN from secondary.

"Access to Services","Only that doctor, it takes weeks to see him. "
"Communication","Better communication.
Staff attitude. "
"Care/ Treatment","Increase my meds"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time with patients"
"Care/ Treatment","Do the correct job. Non religious under funded women being abused for men. Did not maintain eye contact - did not reassure my client. They didn't address our problems correctly and they are very deceptive and unprofessional. I know more about me and my illness and have years of experience. I walked out because of bad manners."
"Care/ Treatment","Stagger picking up weekly medication so that older prisoners can get theirs first and not have to stand in line for half an hour. Supply sun block for cancer sufferers. 

Sometimes I do not feel I have had a proper say in what I need.

I do not always get told what my warfarin dose is so have ??? and use previous dose. "
"Care/ Treatment","Speed up the pharmacy distribution to save time-wasting. Speak plain language to patients so they understand their medical problem clearer. Good or bad. I was kept waiting, in pain for what I thought was too long before the problem was seen and care given. I admit the A+E was busy. He just told me what I was to take and to use. A nurse was left to explain to an old man - she was a young woman. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Employ more clinical psychologists. "
"Environment/Facilities","Make sure machines work before giving them out"
"Access to Services","Quicker appointments"
"Access to Services","I have not yet been seen. An urgent referral was made to Podiatry on 22 July 2016. I have waited 5 weeks to receive an appointment letter, for an appointment on 21 September 2016. A 9 week wait for an urgent referral. I have been left in extreme pain, unable to walk or drive and with an infection which has not resolved with antibiotics. "
"Smoking","Don't stop smoking."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More leave and staff"

"Communication","Better communication"
"Communication","Very nice just when they do the injections - could be nice to tell first why."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff to take me out. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Diabolically ridiculous chronic outrage."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","99.9.3/4% of the time not good look people."
"Care/ Treatment","Unsuitability. Unrealistically. Unreal."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More support levels/meaning increased context with AO staff. "
"Access to Services","My psychologist is very good, but sadly only get 20 sessions. I am about half way through and now only feel I can open up. I am worried as I know I will still need support when she ends and I don't know what is going to happen which worries me."
"Care/ Treatment","Because I am a bright person, I don't feel like my CPN that was, understood me/realised how desperate I am. I felt brushed away. The psychiatrist was good but similar. Bright=coping=wrong!"
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to see a mental health nurse and/or a counselor to help me manage the limitations that my condition places on my life. "
"Care/ Treatment","Deeper understanding into mental health. Suffer from bipolar but personally do not even understand it. Makes it hard to deal with/handle. Also cannot explain/ express feelings and emotions or information to family and friends. "
"Access to Services","The waiting list was so long that I deteriorated massively. This meant I required lots more therapy than I would have otherwise. This was very distressing, but also wasted NHS resources. This was in the last 12 months waiting for a new service. "
"Access to Services","1) The bed crisis, the shrink you see on wards should be more understanding and less assuming. 2) for workers (CPN) to realise when you need help rather than waiting until it gets too bad."
"Access to Services","I don't see the psychiatrist despite being on new meds. Its as if I am seeing a psychologist I don't matter to them and I struggle with that!"
"Care/ Treatment","Please don't give up on mental health. "
"Access to Services","The services could be improved with more psychological sessions in which are longer than one year every 2 weeks. I still needed mine when the sessions had to end."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have been let down and the complain I had was upheld."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt I was seeing too many different people."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","CPN Y was very unhelpful and past all the ? work onto the support worker."
"Access to Services","Would like to have a text alert. "
"Environment/Facilities","Car parking. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Provide support that is not limited to six sessions as its very difficult to get to know and trust someone in a very short period of time. Have some continuity of care if someone is waiting for referral with a  named worker which can be contacted if needed.  As the CRISIS team are particularly unhelpful. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Things could have been worse I suppose. Although we've come some way I feel psychiatry is still in the dark ages. It still feels a bit us and them sometimes. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I seem to be in a healthcare limbo at the moment as do seemingly an awful lot of other folks who are mental health service users."
"Care/ Treatment","I think young people should not be with older people. And you should get better after care. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The sum total of my ""care"" these days is medication and a five minute chat with a psychiatrist every four months."
"Care/ Treatment","There are limited treatment options, if you don't take medicine there is pressure from the staff to discharge you."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Support.There's a long waiting list."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I feel very let down by the Stonbridge Center Nottingham. "
"Access to Services","For the last 16 years, I have suffering with this problem, but I had no councelling, I would like to have regularly. Thank you."
"Care/ Treatment","Depending on your circumstances it would be good if you didn't stay in hospital too long."
"Access to Services","Didn't with - hospital admission, [Bartholomews] as no beds at Highbury - foo for the kids - visit. CAT team nurse led clinics took very long history, said there would be formulation and care planning. I didn't hear of any formulation care planning involved just referral to a group which would not have met my needs. Thankfully the nurse who ran the group referred me into her Mindfulness group which has worked well."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt uncomfortable speaking to doctor as I didn't feel he was listening to my concerns. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would like to be taken much more seriously and get the help I need."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I found it really helped when it was the same person coming each time.  It was difficult if it was a new person who seemed unaware. "
"Care/ Treatment","Research things that you haven't heard of. Just because you haven't heard of doesn't mean they dont exist - eg kundaline English <?>"
"Communication","Liaise with other departments and trust in a better manner. 
Warning a bit stronger turn up at 9pm at night telling me they were taking me to hospital should not have happened. 
The agreement not to inform my next of kin and they were to take me. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","If I have a negative comment, it was inconsistent due to who actually visited. ie there was discrepancies with consistency."
"Care/ Treatment","Highcross Surgery (Arnold) repeatedly loose prescriptions, cancel appointments without warning and are almost impossible to get through to (I called 119 times last occasion to get through). This has caused me side effects due to delays in getting my medication. Despite first applying for my prescription at the earliest opportunity. I have written to the surgery. No response!!"
"Communication","Crisis Team to get back to you. For them to acknowledge that you have been alerted to them by the psychiatrist."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I guess this is an awkward consideration, the aforementioned ""inconsistencies"" were not conducive to a consistent forward moving therapy/understanding. Basically, it comes down to individuals. Those who make the ""home visits"". My overall experience was that some visits were NOT too helpful, good luck with improvements!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The CPN, X X at Manor Road, Carlton, Nottingham. The few times I have managed to see her have not been great experiences. I leave feeling unheard, uninformed and confused about what is to come. I have phoned and visited more than once. She wasn't there but never once has she called to check on me in 6 months, every time I have seen her, I have mentioned continuing but varying degrees of suicidal thoughts."
"Access to Services","More access to talking therapies whilst in hospital and availability. "
"Access to Services","Every time I have been asked for help, I have been left. Help for partner was discussed but not followed through with."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The last time was probably the worst. I left with a leaflet, a referral (that took 3 months) and the words ""good luck"". I am in this level of care because of 3 serious suicide attempts within six months. I am getting back to that point of no one can help it seems. Bye."
"Access to Services","If send A&E in an agitated state it would be helpful to be seen sooner."
"Access to Services","Friend took me to GP on Friday - GP wasn't able to get through to Crisis team until following Wednesday - Crisis team I thin contacted me that Friday & came out following Monday - 10 days later. "
"Access to Services","Although I understand it's hard.  In an ideal world a little more time would be the thing I'd change, and maybe more services/frequency. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Decisions about changing medication could have been made quicker when I was suffering with bad side effects. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More support at night. I am too worried at night. ********** too much at night. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","stop mamba getting on the ward employ more staff"
"Privacy and Dignity","Humanize the patients more e.g. when knocking on a room door leave a few seconds for the patient to answer.  When patient is eating let them eat in peace without pushing them for time.  Kitchen be more punctual on getting food to the ward.  If you stress to follow ward protocol then follow it with supervising visits."
"Care/ Treatment","In the night you must keep the silence."
"Care/ Treatment","Could recommend that the guys on ops at the top of the ward make less noise at night."
"Care/ Treatment","You should stop the attention of prisoner from jail and other correctional. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Was left on my own when I was sent home. "
"Access to Services","Getting into the Mental Health system quicker."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time to see psychiatrist."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Continuity. I have seen too many different psychiatrists."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","************ to stay in hospital longer I was sent home on my own. No care no think. "
"Access to Services","Found it very hard to get into the system when I was first ill."
"Environment/Facilities","No TV, magazines or books. A long time to be sat doing nothing."
"Care/ Treatment","More interaction."
"Communication","I would like to know what my meds are for and explain above them more to me. "
"Access to Services","There appears to be a lack of therapeutic resources, ergo services are less centered to each client's individual requirements. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The crisis team, as my wife has found it necessary to involve the 'public' due to the shortcomings crisis teams. "
"Care/ Treatment","More information about meds."
"Care/ Treatment","I am asked a lot of questions, sometimes, or mostly am not sure why they ask or say what they say and it can and have confused me. For example over 10 years on Quietiapime, 2015 consultants realised no test ever done, did a test my QTS or QTC was nearly 500 too high. They panicked and said stop all the quietiapime now. I scared so they agreed reduce it. Its now am feeling that I have condition which as not been established yet. "
"Access to Services","A lot of services are in working hours so I cant access them."
"Care/ Treatment","More care when I am ill."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The Mental Ward staff they have no patience especially in the Nottingham Q.M.C. I had a very bad experience there I really should of took them to court the way I was treated was bad experience."
"Communication","Communication. The Unit I went to was closed down and I didn't know and was sent elsewhere (the staff I saw in the place thought I was not informed of it."
"Access to Services","Need to open more support in community. There's a lot closed down. Everyone is going for the same. "
"Communication","Maybe the mental health services could keep me up to date with problems more often a little better."
"Physical Health","My excema is getting worse. I think my other tablets could be bringing it on."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","In my opinion the crisis team is not of any use now at all. The team you rang used to be nurses that knew you from working in your team but it was all changed and if you ever phone up they have no idea who you are and in a crisis situation I don't want to start explaining all about everything from scratch then you are not *** offered support I will not phone them - there seems no point (not needed them for a long while). That is what everyone I know has been told myself included."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A bit more time to spend with me please."
"Environment/Facilities","Stonebridge Centre:- waiting area is very bad. Noise is very bad. Staff leaving doors to close on own causing them to themselves (bang!). Waiting area dirty. Torn magazines, no water in m/c or cups. Staff (recp) not very friendly. Spoke to other service users and they agree. Makes me feel more ill when I have to attend there. Hard to get to 2 busses why cannot s/users who live other end of city use other places. H/Hospital small clinic. What about Marlow House? Not being used for out patients."
"Care/ Treatment","It's the only time I have to get a number to be seen by someone in NHS. This is humiliating for me, why can't we give our name at reception as we have to come every 4 wks so they know I'm attending that day. Any body who is waiting in reception knows I am collecting meds because I am holding a number. No one apart from my husband knows I'm taking meds. So this makes me feel vulnerable. "
"Access to Services","Depending on your health have more talk therapy."
"Communication","If the client get angry in counselling meeting because of emotional problem. Don't say I don't like working with people who gets angry. "
"Access to Services","There are no secondary services, some sort of follow up outside my GP."
"Access to Services","Waiting times for psychological treatment are far too long. Access to good talking therapies is too difficult and takes too long, causing symptoms to worsen and patients to suffer for longer"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have been in a loop since leaving WRC, I need further support but my GP cannot access it."
"Access to Services","If talking therapies (i.e physiotherapy) were easier to access and offered more quickly to those who need them it would reduce the need for medication and GP appointments and time off work."
"Care/ Treatment","Sometime too much content per week, so some at end gets rushed.
When undertaking group work not always sufficient time to feedback"
"Access to Services","Maybe more time to explore subject, more role playing."
"Communication","More notice of cancellation. "
"Care/ Treatment","Some role play, more activities than talking. "
"Access to Services","Extend it to 18 months or 2 years"
"Access to Services","No apart from longer courses."
"Access to Services","I can't think of anything.  I am only in my fixed term and I worry about coming to the end of my year.  I hope that there will be some help out there. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Sometimes things are a bit rushed, this is an observation, not a criticism."
"Communication","Signposting of services for family members and how they can support the individual experiencing mental health difficulties. "
"Care/ Treatment","More practical things like sewing, painting, practical housekeeping skills for looking after yourself at a home. "
"Communication","Communication, I received my letter to notify me of changed course times, very late. "
"Care/ Treatment","Have more exercise related courses like Yo Dance. "
"Care/ Treatment","Help more people."
"Access to Services","More publicity of it's availability."
"Access to Services","Longer courses."
"Access to Services","I have been attending the recovery college but unfortunately students are only permitted 3 terms, the service would be greatly improved if students were allowed more than only 3 terms as many people are not ready to move on.  The recovery college is the only chance for many to feel included in the community."
"Environment/Facilities","Bigger sized classrooms for the larger groups? - Not really a massive issue though."
"Environment/Facilities","Have a better waiting area.  Would like to see even more courses. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Courses could be a little more challenging."
"Care/ Treatment","More exercise classes like yo dance etc."
"Access to Services","Kept fronting the primary health courses - so worthwhile"
"Communication","Wish my doctor had known about this service earlier. "
"Communication","Communication - my letter to confirm changed course times, days and venues came when I had almost completed the first term.."
"Access to Services","More courses at the ""Aspley Library"" location.  Re: counselling."
"Care/ Treatment","As with some other courses parts are rushed.  This is an observation NOT a criticism. "
"Access to Services","I had expected the course to run a the college.  Cost quite a bit in taxi fares. "
"Access to Services","Ensure that the primary recovery college courses remain funded. "
"Environment/Facilities","Better room ergonomics"
"Communication","That is difficult to say because the courses are really well run and beneficial.  Maybe making people aware of other groups within the community where you can do relevant activities. Sign posting.  There are a lot of leaflet around the college which is great .  Nottingham has a diverse range of community events - signposting/ linking up. "
"Care/ Treatment","Have more exercise related classe like yo Dance. "
"Access to Services","Offers more than 3 terms here at the recovery college as it really is very helpful."
"Access to Services","Nothing only longer courses."
"Access to Services","Nothing - except make more recovery colleges in more places and make it as accessible as possible. "
"Access to Services","I have attended course at recovery college.  This service could be improved by allowing students to attend for more than 3 terms - currently limited to 3 terms."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","It's improving all the time. "
"Communication","It is a very basic level course, and this wasn't made clear to me and wasn't very suitable to me. "
"Access to Services","Offer this service for more than 3 terms. "
"Access to Services","Longer course's.  3 terms not long enough. "
"Access to Services","Sessions or something like that in which mental health people can really let the NHS know what's happening in their mind."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Would have liked Family therapy to help us as a family and support son to independance.  Initial session started but person was not able to carry on, no one replaced - lack of staff. 
Not easy to set up review meeting with psychiatrist. 
Staff very stretched at times indicating MORE staff needed. 
Need someone to look at effects of medication and whether needs adjusting. 
Staff shortages a worry. 
"
"Communication","More info/input at beginning.  Listen.  Communicate. "
"Environment/Facilities","Nothing at all, maybe just improve the quality of the rooms. "
"Communication","Be honest and transparent about waiting times for assessments. Assess people who have been waiting longest first."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Leave people alone and don't come nearer. "
"Food","Food from canteen.
Training around transgender issues. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","X X looked into for discrimination, lack of professional help, no equality for hierarchy of needs, unprofessional, domineering women, judgemental had no insight into my disabilities, no community care."
"Access to Services","We are all aware money is tight within the NHS especially mental health. The CPN's are on a tight schedule which only allows a certain amount of time which can be crucial when needing care. It's a shame there's not more of the service to go round."
"Care/ Treatment","Judge, jury and executioner ways in approach. Deep sensitive sexual baring talks she judged and did report to GP, I was branded a liar and a thief by this lady. She was rushed and unprofessional."
"Care/ Treatment","prescribe medication "
"Care/ Treatment","Prescribe medication"
"Environment/Facilities","HCAS block ward access to nurses. The ward could be more wheelchair friendly ie bins that are accessible when you cant use your foot. Mirrors of the correct height when in wheelchair."
"Leave","More opportunity for fresh air and exercise.  exercise bike would be good.  Keep fit, pilates, yoga. "
"Care/ Treatment","The availability of talking therapy on the ward would be good."
"Care/ Treatment","Organise activities for the Inpatients
The unit needs more staff on"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Managers actually manage things instead of repeatedly leaning on staff to solve their problems for them.  Actually get off your shining high horses and some xxx work. Like your doctors & nurses. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More one to one time with staff.  More rehabilitation. Sanitary products and washing powder are not always available.  When Dawn is not here there are no activities and it can be boring as there is no therapeutic involvement.  Never enough cups.  Portion size of meals is too small."
"Environment/Facilities","Have unisex toilet available at all times. 
TV would be better on the wall.
Display the artwork in more public areas. "
"Communication","Discuss options with you.  Make people shower and take care of personal hygiene. "
"Environment/Facilities","Provide more space.  Showers are too hot.  Improve air quality.  Let people go home when they don't need to be here."
"Care/ Treatment","Address personal hygiene issues of patients. 
More activities e.g. exercise based. 
Larger portions at meals."
"Access to Services","Waiting times for treatment. Access to a more senior doctor for med review as she just asks me what I want!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes everything should be improved. Even mind mental health charity have had to make changes and now I don't feel I'm getting involved. "
"Care/ Treatment","There has been times i wanted to say, but run out of time."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The last 5 yrs have done more good what-so-ever! And I do not feel care, support, help or understanding is here (esp when needed in a crisis). "
"Care/ Treatment","Not so long between appts every 2-3 months is a long time."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Out-patient psychiatrists. The majority of the psychiatrist team seem very judgemental. "
"Care/ Treatment","Length of time between app - sometimes I feel this is important."
"Access to Services","I have been prosecuted by police and M H workers since 2011 March 20. My health deteriorated. I am racially victimise by police Council social workers ******* medical help left to die. "
"Care/ Treatment","Police should do their jobs without involving health workers. I have been murdered for terrace house. I had police 30 times in very short space of time. "
"Care/ Treatment","CPN bringing PO and other people to torture me to admit to things I have not done, false confession simple, I am frighten to death. Deny food water even walk in the park. I have no one to *******. All I have left is roof over my head. "
"Access to Services","My psychiatrist sought and found provisions for therapy which would have been suitable but decided against them as I work in mental health and know services can be variable and with waiting times. With hindsight I think I could have benefited with regular appointments from my psychiatrist. Luckily I was fortunate to be able to afford and therefore received prompt input. "
"Access to Services","Anyone with enduring mental ill health needs structured occupational therapy. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am still not well at times and do not feel I am making the progress I would like to make."
"Access to Services","More beds available. Better communication between departments. "
"Access to Services","Time, I have been waiting to see the psychiatrist since early Jan. It's now mid-March with no contact. My care was 'forgotten' about and so I had a much longer wait to see them anyway. "
"Access to Services","I would like to be assigned a psychiatric nurse rather than feeling I have to bother my psychologist when there is anything."
"Access to Services","Took 2 1/2 years before got specialist help I required."
"Access to Services","Would like to see them more often. "
"Care/ Treatment","There were mistakes made that were not good to my mental health. "
"Access to Services","I am concerned about the gaps between sessions. I have been told I may 'have this or that' and the lack of appointments/sessions has just left me with more worries. "
"Care/ Treatment","To be more empathic, offer more time and space and less judgement. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The same doctor would be great. Hate having to explain everything to each new doc I see is not good. "
"Care/ Treatment","I think every area of mental health needs improvement! In being in and out of mental health services for ten years and having received no therapies still! My friend has been under mental health for 3 months and has already been offered 3 therapies - and her issues are from seeing me in a horrible state - makes no sense!"
"Care/ Treatment","I've not been given a proper diagnoses yet. "
"Access to Services","Appointment in Jan - cancelled. Feb - cancelled. Mar - cancelled. Lets hope Aprils isn't. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","In the ten years under mental health services, I have had a very bad experience! Even after trying to commit suicide twice I have never received any real care! I have assessments or one off appointments - then never hear from them again! Everyone is very quick to pass paperwork onto the next person and not actually deal with it, rehab was amazing compared to Millbrook!"
"Access to Services","The waiting time is way too long and too difficult to access.  Also phone assessment are to hard, traumatic. "
"Communication","English doctors who understands me more and I can understand them."
"Communication","Listen to the patients more and try to address their needs.  Let them have more freedom on the psychiatry wards, it's like a prison, not enough fresh air time. "
"Care/ Treatment","Ensure current record's & current medications including those from my GP RPC centre Kingfisher practice, follow with me to wherever I am taken."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Use the same member of the team for visits and meetings as opposed to having to repeat the history of the case to three or four different team members."
"Communication","On discharge sheet - explain poss reason for episode."
"Care/ Treatment","At least try to give patients a time on the day of visits, not just a ""day"" - to keep anxiety and stress levels to a minimum!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Mr X X would like more support with his needs. "
"Care/ Treatment","Would like a meeting twice a year instead of once a year with my social worker and CPN."
"Care/ Treatment","There is an over-reliance on medication. "
"Care/ Treatment","Would like to learn first aid."
"Care/ Treatment","only issue was that it would have been beneficial if there was ??? her own age in the mist. "
"Access to Services","My case was closed prematurely and I have struggled to be re-referred for the support I desperately need."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Due to the amount of people the mental health team have to see and how over stretched the teams are, I feel more professionals should be put into place. More appointments and support should be provided."
"Access to Services","I am ready for further TMS treatment, but it is awaiting funding. If this doesn't come through soon, I may have to have ECT which wasn't anywhere near as helpful as TMS and resulted in me losing a great deal of my memory."
"Access to Services","A bit more time with the psychiatrist every 6 months. "
"Care/ Treatment","Greater awareness by mental health professionals about possible discrimination to patients in the work place."
"Care/ Treatment","People and their needs should be met on both sides, professional and patients. People before money, money is paper - people are more important than paper!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Please recognize that like other aspects of the NHS, mental health services are desperately under staffed and excellent psychiatrists are being put under a great deal of strain. You and I don't want to lose such excellent care."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","In the present climate with cuts and several staff consequently - the remaining staff have to work with increased pressure and work loads they are coping with things as best as they can. So realistically not a lot."
"Food","Tha catering is appalling. It's inconsistent & high in carbohydrates."
"Communication","More time staff talking to patients about their concerns."
"Privacy and Dignity","Respect our personal bed space as important. I have found that another patient getting into my be stressful at times. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There is staff I'd like to talk about but can't on the paper. 
Communication ??? nurses poor"
"Privacy and Dignity","Bit more privacy in toilets, even if one to one apart apart from that this place is perfect. "
"Communication","More communication skills."
"Smoking","Smoking facilities"
"Environment/Facilities","Facilities i.e. more than one to area, exercise area. "
"Environment/Facilities","Bathrooms - the sensors don't work & the basin stain, the shower gets in your eyes, it's cold at first. "
"Environment/Facilities","Single rooms."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More people like Karen (OT), has a good program for patients to get involved with."
"Environment/Facilities","Showers leak. Could do with laminated glass doors in showers. Do not state accusations at tribunal unless you have evidence. The result is not justified and the judge and second psychiatrist are swayed by the evidence."
"Care/ Treatment","More training. 
Staff continuous imposed assessment to new ????"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Only assess patients mental staff if you know them and have treated them before.  I have had 3 different consultants in 2 weeks.  How can a stranger assess my mental health if he/she doesn't know what I'm like when I'm well.  Nurses & care workers have to spend too much time doing paper work/typing while staring at computer screens (90% of the job) instead of nursing & caring for patients to bet better/well.  The job is difficult enough without all the red tape. "
"Food","Food"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Some care, consistency would be appreciated! Both Millbrook & Kings Mill Hospital have never failed to disappointment me with my parents & dearest freinds treatment - it is dire!!"
"Access to Services","No I and my husband and disgusted with mental health care. I have gone from being supported in the community to being left without no care in the community. "
"Access to Services","My next appointment is in April it a bit long from my test to getting results so I know whats happening. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Since my very long-term Dr @ BDGH changed and then consultant retired/changed over. Everything with my care/your services/all gone down. And I've gone down along way mentally (and therefore physically and with all other conditions also. "
"Access to Services","No - not really. I am still waiting since August 2015 for my therapy at Milbrook Mental Health Unit, Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts. I think this is absoultely disgusting! I have had to keep ringing up to find out when my therapy will start. All I have got is a vague answer of it could take 10 months - 1 year for my therapy to start. "
"Care/ Treatment","Team that handle med review (different to therapy team) don't know how to treat me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","(August 2015) I was told by a liaison psychiatric nurse attending the MDU after I had taken a big overdose that I should move back to the city of my birth even though I stated I didn't now anybody there. She told me I was a very unhappy man. Why else would I have taken an overdose? She was condescending and ******* ******."
"Care/ Treatment","If a psychiatrist prescribes medication then they should write the prescription and do pre-tests not pass-the-book to the GP. Had major difficulties getting on prescribed meds because of this."
"Access to Services","I am very disappointed my request for CMHT/CPN has been denied."
"Access to Services","Waiting times are too long."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","CBT working time needs to be reduced drastically (more therapists needed)."
"Access to Services","Yes! I think it's about time that the government started putting more money into mental health services! I was told that in the whole area around Mansfield, Nottingham. There is only 2! therapists at Milbrook. Hence the long waiting list. (Pyscotherapists)"
"Communication","Listening and understanding, no being rude and calling a ill lady ""a walking junkie"" saying then can have a CPN. "
"Care/ Treatment","Need some therapy classes, art, etc they have been taken away, I have nothing. "
"Access to Services","If you have to have an understudy why does it have to last only 6 months. Can't this be made easier on the patients. "
"Access to Services","General contact with allocated psychiatrist. Often unavailable to discuss medication, wait 10 weeks for appointments and it feels like a waste of time, "
"Environment/Facilities","Psychiatrists office could be less formally arranged. Had CRUSE counselling recently which enabled me, because of nice chairs, pictures, to feel more relaxed and able to ""off load"" my bereavement."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Sleeping issues as they are dismissed."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I received a great standard of care in a different trust."
"Access to Services","To be honest any help that I have needed - I have had to do all the chasing myself. I have constantly when I have been up to Millbrook seen a different person every time. They just want you in and out as quickly as possible. Basically very, very poor quality care at Millbrook. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Then they can't crisis team should not tell people that they are going to make their children depression and self harm like their mam. "
"Care/ Treatment","When I see the psychiatrist I always see an under study which I find hard as every 6 months I have to explain everything from the start. As doing this can be very upsetting as I tend to try and block things out. "
"Care/ Treatment","Now I see the Crisis Team if I am unsure about meds and just use allocated psychiatrist as a vessel for referrals to psychotherapy groups etc... no information on how I can change psychiatrist when I would like to."
"Care/ Treatment","This appointment was also cancelled I was sent another appointment for March 2015 only to be cancelled once again. I have another appointment for April 2016. If this appointment goes ahead I will not have seen a psychiatrist for 5 months."
"Communication","Communication. I heard nothing since my initial assessment visit. Would like to know who is in charge of my care."
"Access to Services","I feel more money put into mental health issue is needed, the cuts to the service has a big impact on length of availability and interrupts continuance. Therefore you just get to know someone and them your issue, then have a wait and start over again with someone different. The system is good for small issues - and extreme but not in between therefore leading to potential extension of mental health issues."
"Access to Services","Getting the help you need is very difficult. I have had bad experiences of GP's who don't listen and a trainee GP seeing me in the casualty department in hospital, from the crisis team, who was inexperienced and missed the fact that I was suicidal. It was after a suicide attempt that I finally got the help I needed. This happened 5 years ago."
"Access to Services","More boots on the ground. Better pay. "
"Access to Services","The groups could last a bit longer than they usually do."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I have had to ask for a different psychiatrist because of his attitude towards me and my illness which was inappropriate "
"Care/ Treatment","Do your best to ensure more service users attend to create good discussions. Hold discussion groups on the course- break out groups."
"Access to Services","More sessions"
"Access to Services","Make group longer"
"Care/ Treatment","I was recommended to attend a group course on anxiety and depression, that didn't deal with depression, by my psychiatrist Dr XX.  The course held by Xxx Xxx & Xxx Xxx was titled 'course outlin anxiety and depression' had no content for coping with or dealing with depression and Xxx Xxx who did my assessment did mention this which makes me wonder why I was put on this course. it made my depression substantially worse and despite a report to the contrary made my anxiety worse which until this I had been coping ok with.  It was like being back at an infants school, mostly thanks to Xxx Xxx methods of 'counseling'  I am now back to having suicidal thoughts.... The only thing that helped my depression was Transcranial Magnetic stimulation, which I understood to be just experimental, I need more!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Great facility, had a lot of help but sometimes overwhelming. I am afraid I have had too many changes in my health workers, if not for that I was say excellent."
"Access to Services","Access to individual counselling. I was not offered this via NHS - suggested I contacted women's centre. "
"Care/ Treatment","A wider range of therapy options - CBT is not effective for a lot of people. Much more frequent contact, a less formal environment would be less stress/anxiety inducing. Information about alternative treatment to medications and CBT would be very helpful."
"Care/ Treatment","Talking therapy as I cant see a CPN because of other conditions, so they cant help me. Access to mental health outside hours of 12.00 to 17.00 Monday to Friday"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Too many changes in whom is caring/in charge of my health. They keep going on sick for months. One after the other, very distressing."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","After being told I had a personality disorder I was told to self refer to a different organisation. I was given the wrong number for this organisation. Once I had found the correct contact details, I was then told that I could not self refer."
"Care/ Treatment","To get to the bottom of my problem. Don't talk about it, they are not bothered. Waste of time!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Found it very unhelpful seeing different SHO's and then prescribing nurse - no continuity. Prescribing nurse very unhelpful and unsupportive, think people with depression need continuity with care givers, especially when experiencing difficulties in trying to find correct medication."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel like I have been abandoned from the service. My therapy was stopped as I wasn't stable/showing enough commitment and my psychiatrist sent me back to my GP because I couldn't attend my appointments due to work. Work is necessary for me to keep routine and stable, but this doesn't mean I don't need support. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I find the crisis team can be rude and unhelpful on occasions. They need to know how to relate to vulnerable adults. "
"Communication","After a telephone assessment the reason should not be stated in a letter to the GP."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The locum system meant that I saw someone new every 3 months which was damaging to my treatment as they did not understand my situation so I had to repeat myself every time. More flexible talking therapies must be made available."
"Access to Services","Quicker referral time. Updates on how long it may be before you see someone new I start new treatment. "
"Communication","The notice boards in the waiting area could be a little less cluttered and updated more often."
"Care/ Treatment","Better integration with after-care services. I have often perceived a 'cold shoulder' when volunteering for a peer support service. "
"Access to Services","The system for contacting services in a crisis is slow and cumbersome."
"Access to Services","There is not an adequate system in place for students like myself who live at home for 5 months and at Univ for the other 7, it would be helpful to have access to both services, as I have ended up with inadequate support while at Uni due to being unable to speak to Crisis Services ***"
"Access to Services","For any help that I am offered I have to travel and that causes difficulties for me (walking to a bus stop, driving or paying for a taxi)"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","When someone goes on sick they just replace them without your input and refer you to other things you don't want."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have been let down, I would not wish this treatment on anyone, yet alone someone with mental health problems. Please do something to change the state of our mental health care."
"Care/ Treatment","Keep giving you tablets, nothing else concerns then!"
"Access to Services","One should be able to talk to staff at George Rd W.B. before 12 noon at Rushcliffe Mental Health Team when people are very ill. "
"Care/ Treatment","The pediatric services were brilliant however the transfer to adult services was handled appallingly and caused me to relapse due to a lack of support."
"Care/ Treatment","I ask for little but am to join the cull of stable (non crisis) patients from NHS."
"Access to Services","The service is good once you get there but the waiting time is ridiculous. This needs to be improved. Took me a year to be transferred."
"Access to Services","Waiting times are too long. What has happened to ""No decision about me, without me""? We are not our mental health diagnosis. "
"Record Keeping","The Rio database has the potential to be used negatively. (I have experience of this). Rio is a breach of trust. Why are service users not told about Rio. I found out from a throw away comment."
"Communication","Communication from receptionists, they were ill informed regarding parking and dismissive of my confusion at a stressful time.  I felt as though they were not bothered & didn't listen to me properly. "
"Communication","Listen to the concerns of both the patient and their carers without patronising them
patronising us and making it clear our wellbeing was not priority. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The reception staff need to be taught how to look after vulnerable service users.  I find their lack of empathy and care disgusting.  Most of all their response to a crying service user asking about parking was reprehensible vague and unhelpful.  It exacerbated an already traumatic experience beyond acceptable levels. "
"Communication","P.H.C is XXXX
Communicating with you - some staff are better than others. 
Involving in decisions - Sometimes I feel I don't know what is going on. 
Positive difference - I'm new so I don't alway see thing as positive. 

"
"Communication","Communicating, both with patients and between departments. 
Sometimes security or safeguarding would get in the way of my health."
"Communication","Get physical help when needed. Listening to you - they are XXXX  When I needed to talk I couldn't have the time. "
"Smoking","Let the patients smoke. "
"Access to Services","Include more regular education sessions i.e. daily to reduce sentence times.  Trust me, they're mostly too long.
Lack of resources, music therapy services. Staff are sometime too casual in dialogue/???.
There's involvement & there's really taking on board about, say, sentance times, levels of sanity etc. 
"
"Communication","Serve a much better care area.  
communication - sometimes it differs. 
Involving in care/treatment - unhelpful people are in control. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Yes"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Move patients on faster through system to show them the've got a chance in life. 
I've been on ICU and don't seem to move forward. 
You can't say the samething everyday can you move me on.
I don't know what happens with my care. 
Positive difference - I well enough to be in the community. "
"Care/ Treatment","Less stresses placed upon care about patients more than policies and procedure. 
Service - depends on the staff they all have different ways of doing things.
Listen - some listen and twist the story.
Communication - most of the time they no ???? on staff.
Respect - I meet their wishes they don't meet mine. 
Positive difference - sometime I feel I'm treated like little boy and it depresses me. 
"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Earlier information of MH act changes. 
Respect - can at times be stretched due to trust
Positive difference - I don't always listen. 
Communicating - I tend to be wary of confident professionals. "
"Communication","A few on ward rules could be different but apart form that I think things are fine. 
Some staff are easy to talk to and some staff aren't. 
I don't always get told everything. "
"Communication","To make them understand and to make it a better and back."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More ethnic Integration into the community"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff."
"Communication","Walking and debating should be part of structured day. 
Not enough field walks"
"Care/ Treatment","More physical activity, outdoor activity.  More active MDT. Faster pace of treatment programmes, takes longer than necessary.
Listen to you - none of suggestions are accepted.  Decisions are made by MDT your suggestions & request are not listened too. 
 "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Only thing I would like is consistency and more time with head to head team now - for the first time in months I have at last seen little signs of improvement."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not sectioning me. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Longer sessions when we meet up."
"Communication","My opinion got listened to more."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would of liked a few more 1-1's with the staff but they are always busy."
"Communication","Being listened to not just heard. Gender identity needs not met."
"Care/ Treatment","More sports, swimming. More 1-1's. Everything needs improving."
"Care/ Treatment","Sessions with staff were cancelled without telling me. Communication could be improved."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything appalling service nobody calls u back they shift the blame onto the patience should be shut down "
"Access to Services","The care was excellent the only problem was the initial waiting list.  It too two years for my daughter to be seen & diagnosed which is FAR too long."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More nurses like the ones her at Clayfields"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The therapist took her time to understand the issues.  It is hard to comment that."
"Care/ Treatment","More consistency with appointments/plans as people I know (and myself) were often left not knowing when next visits were or needed appointment to touch base."
"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes appointments are late."
"Care/ Treatment","Appointments are often late"
"Communication","Maybe have an email address (generic) for the team for if as a parent I had a query that wasn't so urgent I needed to ring but I needed a reply between appointments. "
"Access to Services","Initial referral took a while to get an initial appointment but once in the system all was good."
"Care/ Treatment","As I was treated for an eating disorder, I feel that some conversations needed to be about me and how I was feeling as a person, because when I was really ill I thought all that CAMHS cared about was weight & eating (even though I know that wasn't the case now I am better). But for ill people I think it would be beneficial to talk about life in genral as well."
"Environment/Facilities","The location is grim and old fashioned. "
"Access to Services","Be open longer or weekends.  Be easier to reach therapist. "
"Access to Services","I felt like the waiting times should be shorter and I think it would be beneficial to have sessions alone with parents to discuss what the parent could do to help.
"
"Care/ Treatment","Go out on trips for a day and get to know me more."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Keep the connection going until the patient doesn't want it any more."
"Access to Services","I can't think of anything - I just wish that Xxxx had accessed the service earlier and avoided the extreme measures that she took to get help."
"Communication","Flexibility & communication"
"Leave","More leave"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff try their best- staffing numbers are sometimes low so things get cancelled. "
"Care/ Treatment","More time to spend with patients doing activities. "
"Care/ Treatment","Would like more to do on the ward.  More OT services."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything"
"Smoking","Let us smoke"
"Communication","Close the place.
Listening to you: ye right. 
Communicating with you: - we got told
Respect: got to be joking. 
Involved with decision: No
Positive difference: Making me worse"
"Care/ Treatment","More OT and activities on the ward & between the wards e.g. inter ward pool competition.
More session in close succession would improve the service. 
Shining a torch and turning lights on when you are asleep is not respectful.
Decision making process is slow and option to be involved in the decision making process would be improve (ward round every week). "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more night staff. "
"Access to Services","A more controlled, less pressurised urgently during the discharge process."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","If you could turn the clock back. "
"Communication","Get patients to read leaflets available on wall brackets. Also give new patients Cherry Ward Handbook on first day of entry."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Be given more money from the local & national government. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing level make it difficult sometime to call someone when help is needed at once, maybe volunteer worker could help in some cases. "
"Access to Services","I have used the NHS carers break for a sitting service but this is under threat as criteria has changed. "
"Access to Services","I have received no support after my fall 9 years ago either for my physical or mental health issues that arose from it. I feel let down and angry by this system. The lack of physio was very upsetting. "
"Communication","More information on other people to contact - professional or others in similar situation."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I feel there are areas that I could have been helped more than would improve my quality of life."
"Care/ Treatment","In an ideal world access to more social activities"
"Access to Services","Continuous support and advice as well as more activities. The memory cafe and singing for the brain come recommended but both are over subscribed with waiting lists."
"Access to Services","At the moment I am receiving a monthly health care visit. But I am fearful that this might be withdrawn at any time. Leaving me isolated from help. This will have a disastrous effect on my well being if it happens!"
"Care/ Treatment","Mental llintraed not farmed out to private and voluntary organisation. Doctors surgeries should be much more involved with their patients needing mental health care. Very little is done for patients once their mental health illness has been diagnosed!"
"Communication","Supplementary information to be provided. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","In my experience in hospital (outside Mental Health, but related) their appears a lack of calmness and things being in control and nurses and doctors rushing around. Where in my experience mistakes are made on a regular basis which takes time to be rectified. Co-ordination poor - appointments on telephone and by letter."
"Access to Services","Mum has been signed off from mental health care, if needed it is necessary to start the whole process again through the GP. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Support for my husband. He had no support while I was ill. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Hospital Dr X poor"
"Care/ Treatment","I and many of the friends and relatives I am in touch with would be willing to pay partly for our medication and support in other areas where it would help to make a difference, it would help us make some people think twice about receiving medication that more often than not they never use. This does not include people who are not as fortunate financially as me."
"Access to Services","As a wife whose husband has mental health needs, I am now receiving support but feel it was very slow coming, I felt confused and very alone when my husband was diagnosed."
"Environment/Facilities","Noisy patients with severe mental problems should be separated from quick patients with depression."
"Care/ Treatment","(do not like the tablets)"
"Access to Services","I feel group meetings might be helpful and also to have some local courses available for Mental Health instead of having to travel to the Recovery College at Mapperley. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Once the situation had deteriorated to the extent my wife had to be sectioned and taken into mental hospital the system began to function well.  Idiotically we live in the Nottingham City but our GP being in the county (Rushcliffe) neither functioned as they should have!  They are not aware of my wife's condition? Frontal lobe Dementia? Clearly was not understood by ?? GP's or the Lings Bar Psychiatric Team."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Better GP awareness of mental health issues. That better support from GPs. "
"Access to Services","Slowness of the referral and failure to advise who you are being passed to for assessment (psychiatrist, psychologists etc etc). In my own case referred by GP to diagnosis took 18 months and involved 4 or 5 different professional staff."
"Access to Services","Could have been sorted out sooner at GP level."
"Communication","It would have been useful and comforting to know not only who I was being passed to for assessment but also why and for what purpose."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The staff on the wards work very hard & long hours.  Perhaps the powers that be could give them more support in some way."
"Communication","You could give people more information about the forms of communication supplied. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Most things"
"Care/ Treatment","Group therapy would be good on the ward once a week. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","On entering main reception of the Millbrook unit at 10AM to see a relative who have been admitted overnight, We were immediately told visiting hours did not start until 2PM! The receptionist 'reluctantly' rang the ward and was told visiting was ok. Not a good first impression! Certainty not 'positive'!! Actual ward visiting were 10AM-8PM (excellent)."
"Access to Services","Send me to have x-ray at orthopedic ward, could have speeded things up. "
"Food","Too much food.  Sweetcorn always in food - don't like it. 
Not enough staff, people have to wait, should be more.
Had 4 different doctors.  Haven't seen me but had other patients, not fair.  Doctors coming and going. "
"Care/ Treatment","I enjoyed going to Mill Brook, but that is finished now and i cant remember what I am supposed to do next."
"Access to Services","Follow up care, I was ""processed"" then left to get on with it."

"Care/ Treatment","Weekly diary of things they have done as Dad has trouble remembering what he has been doing in group."

"Access to Services","I am Bi-Polar and an amputee. No support given or offered to support my mental health to deal with physical life changing disabilities. "
"Access to Services","It would be a good idea so you could keep in touch say one's a year, I know it costs money ******. I think it would be cheaper in the long run. With the same person. "
"Access to Services","Continuing care - not received. Regular support in 9 years. "
"Care/ Treatment","I have had depression for 44 years and the only thing to help is medication yet still I am constantly told that talking therapies are better. "
"Environment/Facilities","There should be a room where you both sit and talk it is better than a office. "
"Care/ Treatment","Yes, a meeting between the carer and the mental health team without the service user present. It can be very distressing to have your carer change your answers or correct what answer you give because you cant remember and say anything whether right or wrong."
"Access to Services","Yes:- more often home contact. "
"Access to Services","Given information about support groups in the community but I was not eligible for some of them which was disappointing."

"Access to Services","More time with the professionals I felt I was discharged back to my GP too quickly. "
"Care/ Treatment","Meds could be improved and more varied. "
"Environment/Facilities","I would like more space to be allocated for personal use. I would like an individual self-contained unit where I could have my printer u bit to print photographs. Easier access to Doctor."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To do better they would have to employ more staff to cope with all situations."
"Communication","I would like more information about how I came to be on this ward. The medication seems to be working but I would have liked to know why it has changed. I cannot understand why I cannot have my own phone on the ward to phone whoever I want."
"Communication","Communication. Doors are noisy. Cleanliness can be improved. Less waiting when you ask for something."
"Care/ Treatment","Ensure admission to the ward is handled sensitively and with necessary preparation having been completed. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff to help as existing staff have to work so hard and are always having to rush.  In spite of this they are always pleasant and caring. "
"Access to Services","The WAD service is no longer funded therefore this has left us in a position of no/little care/support. No clear plan was left in place when the service was cut. "
"Care/ Treatment","Consultant *** time at app's."
"Care/ Treatment","The diagnosis took too long to find Nigel had dementia, the first 5 years was very lonely without much support."

"Communication","please don't keep sending these questionnaires. My husband is unable to fill them in, I have done it the best I can."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Very disappointed in MH services in the community. All round needs massive improvement. "
"Privacy and Dignity","This form would be better aliened for the carer as with dementia the person who you sent the form to have no idea how to fill it in or why they need to development of a form for the carer would be a much better idea."
"Care/ Treatment","Classing people with dementia, or treating people with dementia with same as other mental health illness doesn't work. They should be treated differently."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","To assist the families, please recognise dementia when issuing sections under the Mental Health Act, very distressing."
"Communication","Communication. "
"Care/ Treatment","Have fewer carers - need to get to know much, much better & respond to the change in her.  Keep up with information given to you & supposedly recorded in you office.  Not leave her without bread, milk and toilet paper, I was appalled & upset about this as was my sister.  If doing her washing (only needed once while I was away) Don't leave it for 3 weeks & not use detergent provided by me.  "
"Access to Services","Any visitation from mental health specialist. Speedier response from social workers."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","All staff were good, but my dad spent 18 weeks in Milbrook Kings Mill Hospital, he has come out worse than what he went in, he is now in a care home, he has been crying since he came out of Milbrook, but nobody is doing anything about it."

He was not qualified to issue me with my prescription and I went without my medication for 2 days. "

"Access to Services","Venue closer to home. Mum and I travel together, we both have appointments. Takes a long time with travel."
"Communication","Generally extremely positive, except for ******* not having notification about doctors leaving/joining service, eg I arrived to see one consultant who I have seen for some years, only to find she has moved to unit in another city. Her replacement was very nice, but a similar thing recurred. Would prefer to know by eg letter before arriving at appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","My therapist being late for a lot of appointments. Lots of appointments cancelled (and not re-arranged) due to annual leave and days holiday here and there."

"Care/ Treatment","More clear options to see different therapists and shorter waiting times."

"Care/ Treatment","The treatment wasn't explained sufficiently. I saw someone for some weeks then passed to next stage. No explanation of the stages of therapy. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","(1) The time was short 1 hour is not enough, 2 hours or 1.5 is better. (2) Please, it is very important to deal with conscious and sub conscious minds and tell them the patient how the mind works, this will help the patient and will skip him/her many stages."
"Access to Services","Waiting times for talking therapies. "
"Care/ Treatment","I am not happy that the person I saw lied to my GP and sent me back to my GP and Xmas, because I was having trouble with coping with my dads health and I needed the help from the mental team, but they just sent me back to my GP so I have now got to start all over again. I am not coping at all. Please help me."

Mistreatment getting wound up mental abuse.

Positive difference - mistreatment, it shouldn't have happened."
"Food","Not as much sugar & more health meals. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","appalling that Mental Health patients aren't allowed to smoke!!!
90% of them do.  No lame excuses get on to the trust. Dept of health doesn't ban it, before we complain about staff privileges!!!
Most staff on ward disaffected and disinterested!!!
Service - you haven't got a box for pitiful
Listening - Listen!!! don't think you've heard the word, most of your patients wan a free playstation.
Communication - you've nothing of quality to communicate. 
Respect - nag nag XXX nag
Involving - Pitiful, expert doctors giving license to patients to choose meds.  You either know what you're doing or you don't.  Most patient would prefer to have been ??????????
Positive difference - are you having a XXX laugh.  5 stone overweight, handicapped by drugs and told to exercise. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Nobody wants to be locked up and have less rules. 
Some staff I find can be very disrespectful & rude. "
"Smoking","Let me smoke"
"Access to Services","More education courses.  More OT Courses.  
Ward rounds could do with being longer. "

"Care/ Treatment","Implement least restrictive practice.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Be more objective, subjective and effective and disarming.  
Communicating - different or indifferent in exposure. 
Service is fair - because I'm neither here nor there.
"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have staff not to moan and be negative around patients or about each other. 
I have intrinsically developed, psychology has helped but the books I read help me better.
Some staff don't show you respect"
"Access to Services","Could discharge the well patients and get the poorly ones in a bit quicker. 
Sometimes I have to chase things up a few time to get an answer. "
"Care/ Treatment","See more of family and friends. 
"
"Care/ Treatment","Stick to appointments down healthcare. "
"Access to Services","Need full time Dentist & Optician because without glasses can't see. Need better healthcare, I'm still in pain and no one knows what is wrong with me. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Don't know how he became a doctor.  
Taken care of my illness was not given. 
Left me with pain all the time and dismissed every other Dr that has seen me. 
Telling me only & said that i'm not a nice man.  Because a person is in prison it doesn't mean that you should live in pain or lack at health care.
Respect - non at all, I called him mate as I do every one & her snapped I'm not your mate. 
Involving in care/treatment - Just telling me I have to like it or not. 
My health feels lower than it has for some time. "
"Access to Services","Quicker appointments for genuine patients who need to be seen within 24hrs.  Maker prescriptions easier to carry on when last medicine finished.
Long delays. 
when seeing nurse I did feel a tad steamrollered into decision.  Last Treatment didn't work by nurse continued. 
Sometimes felt a little frustrated at getting appointment. "
"Access to Services","See people faster, I am still trying to get the help I need and be waiting 2 months & still not seen a doctor. Communication:- one person tells me one thing then the next say different, it's like some won't help otheres don't seem to care.  My doctor cut my meds without even seeing me and still hasn't.  I'm getting worst in more pain as time goes on without treatment. some of you listening but you don't seem to be able to do anything. "
"Access to Services","Give sooner appointments in everything, it took me 5 months to get appointment "
"Communication","Tell them the truth.  None of my complaints answered the the question that I asked in the first place. I was given 4 different reason as to why I did not get the items I needed to keep me healthy. Note being told the truth and covering up mistakes.  This has topped me from being able to walk and now have to use my wheelchair all the time. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Stop kicking people out that need your help or things will go wrong, like more people killing them self in prison.
Service - it was poor as I was told that you cannot help me in anyway. 
Communication - It was fair in some communicating but was not a help in anyway.
I was not told about what care or treatment I can get in anyway.
As no one is helping me in my health and wwellbeing so I guess it ok if I kill myself."
"Communication","When an appointment is cancelled let the wing know. "

"Access to Services","See us more often, offer more support."

"Communication","They are all XXXX
Don't listen to me!
I could die!"
"Care/ Treatment","Bring in AA NA groups"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","XXXX XXXX was appalling in the way he conducted the sessions. He seemed ill at ease,shambolic,  inexperienced, disorganised and seemed set on putting me 'into a box' of symptoms rather than truly listening to and taking on board the difficulties I was experiencing and for which I had sought help. The issues I presented with have not been addressed or resolved and when he stopped the sessions because he realised they weren't working and I asked if I could be referred to another therapist, he told me there was quote 'No point, as all therapists are trained in the same way and would want to conduct the sessions in a similar fashion'. He has suggested a course of mindfulness might help but the next available course doesn't start until January.. He has discharged me and I now have to re-apply for this. I have waited many weeks for this therapy and I feel I have received no help whatsoever. I have successfully had CBT and counselling in the past, but more than 10 years ago. I am left still feeling extremely unwell and now feel I have been left completed isolated with nowhere to get help.   Not a lot. I feel as if I had to have many assessments in order to be able to receive therapy:- by telephone, then again online and then again when the CBT started:- almost the whole of the first CBT session was taken up with this and going through and filling in a counselling agreement, even though this had already been done prior to the CBT starting and even though I told XXX XXXX this. The CBT was very poor with no direction or explanation of why we were discussing particular things. The counselor didn't seem to know how to handle the sessions, he was very disorganised, not being able to find sheets in his file, dropping things and not being able to access information on his lap top. We seemed to jump from one thing to another without ever really addressing the reason why I had sought counselling. Every week when he asked me what I wanted to do in the session I plainly stated at the "
"Care/ Treatment","This was roughly four years ago now, I felt so debilitated and afraid at the time I didnt feel confident enough to give feedback, I did file a complaint but did not feel strong enough to follow it up. I was at a very vulnerable point in my life suffering after a recent trauma from an abusive relationship and I had associative symptoms of de-personalisation and de-realisation. I took all the information I had found from the charity MINDs website to the second appointment to explain how I was feeling, because I knew from my research that there wasn't much awareness of these disorders. This was all completely disregarded by the lets talk well being member of staff I had my appointment with. I was told that the symptoms I was feeling such as feeling dissociated from myself and not recognising my reflection were actually the beginnings of schizophrenia, which completely terrified me, and the only advice I was given was to go swimming as regular exercise would help and to drink slim fast as I felt unable to eat and had lost a drastic amount of weight within the last few months. I felt completely let down and really sunk into myself after this appointment. It was also very hard to get to as I did not drive and I lived in a village quite far away."

"Environment/Facilities","Parking"
"Care/ Treatment","Make it easier to make an appointment.  I spent hours on the telephone trying to get through without any success.  In the end I went to Park House and asked them who do I complain to.  They gave the phone number which I called and they arrange for them to call me to arrange an appt. However I do not wish to have to do this every couple of months when I need an appointment.  You could also do away with the irrelevant questions about religion and sexuality "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Bank staff should be more approachable and show more interest in their job.  They should also introduce themselves to patients.  There should be two nurses at night."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff"
"Communication","Formalise discharge information and follow up pack for ongoing program. Afternoon car parking spaces very poor."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Real problem with bank staff members, not making effort to introduce themselves, no ID often, so didn't know who was on ward, felt uneasy, uncomfortable.  Often asked what number we were not names, didn't seem to care about their job.  Lack of respect towards patients, no dignity, very pleasant experience. "

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Less tasks/paperwork for nurses so they ha e more time for patients."

"Communication","Did not receive expected phone call but knew meeting was late in the day."
"Care/ Treatment","Make services fit with patients needs. I have to wait for psychotherapy to be started again because of your ""tick-box"" system. Not tailored to patient needs. Not throw my name around different teams without my consent. You are pathetic in your attitude to personal needs in the community. ** Totally ignore my needs to the extent that I tried to end my life **.
Resources wasted with follow-up services that do nothing at all."
"Care/ Treatment","There should be a better awareness within primary care + other main referrers to mental health services to avoid referral into crisis team when it's unnecessary - Very Disjointed!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Send the same CPN to visit. I had 5/6 different ones. Not make crass comments regarding serious subjects (only one CPN but quite shocking). Some visits were very short, as if they didn't have a lot of time. "
"Communication","I understand services are very stretched, however, I feel communication with my GP could have been improved. It was several weeks before my GP received a letter detailing my initial crisis assessment, which meant that my GP appointments were spent describing the previous crisis appointment. Perhaps communicating electronically would help?"
"Communication","Listen to what service users are saying to you, rather than just make assumptions. Consistency in who deals with service users and better communication between individuals."
"Communication","You need to have a purpose to you intervention rather than just talking at people.  You need to listen more and develop a plan of action base on your discernment and then review the plan at the next visit.  7 hrs service is a waste of tax payers money."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","The staffing levels could be better, which is no reflection on the staff that were on the ward who did their best.  The food was bland, boring, not very tasty and limited in choice. "
"Environment/Facilities","Shower chair - shower ??? longer - disattached faucet & also to Bidet on toilet - separate for ???.  A screen around the freestanding bath tube bathroom."
"Involvement","Obverse confidentiality between patient and professional also get patient to write or record on memo space & version of their opinion decision, reports & thoughts as well as the person that sits and converses with them, please give them a choice to voice themselves by giving them the benefit of the doubt especially when they know whats right & wrong with them or even the carer etc please?  So far because there's too many set books my opinion is very mixed up about Rowan 2.  Even though you are my friends I still don't believe that you have gained my trust "
"Access to Services","Respond to requests either quicker or if not possible give the person an alternative time.
Food could be vastly improved. "

Put the TV on the wall and make more space by getting rid of cabinet and wast of a small table & condense all ??? in the main tall cupboard - well organised & ????"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Better disable access. "
"Care/ Treatment","Order medication in a timely fashion so that they don't run out of essential drugs (in my case painkillers). I have an extremely serious allergy problem & I had to buy my own anti-histamines etc on the advice of a boots pharmacist. Treat patients with respect & compassion. Not threaten people with pin downs first because they are upset or angry. Discharge people faster - sometimes there is more than a weeks delay because the psychiatrist is running late. Not section people of a medical ward & then not do the appropriate treatment/investigation. In my case an abdominal scan, a cat scan for my head injury. Blood tests for allergy related Oedema. Not have hard beds. I have bad osteo-arthritis & sleep is impossible in those beds. I was given a mattress topper, but it was taken away from me. I was also denied antibiotics when i had an abscess in my gums.

Highbury makes me despair. It's the last place on earth I would want to be if I was depressed. It cost me over a thousand pounds in taxis because I live the other side of the city (Ruddington). GP's in West Bridgford, Dentist in Clifton.

People may listen but not understand or understand & ignore anyway."

"Food","Tea/coffee <?>, utensils, plates. Asian foods in menu. Smoke-free area especially toilet."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Where do we start? Shut the place down and start again, with properly trained staff. Most of the staff show no respect to the patients; mix up medications; have no empathy or understanding of patient needs. Even more worrying, they really don't care!!!

"Care/ Treatment","Involve the family more.  My daughter is in her 30's but as her mother I have been left feeling that my concerns, views, background knowledge of my daughter are of no consequence.  As a former teacher, I see the relevance & need for a holistic approach & feel that this has been significantly lacking at times.  I accept and appreciate the need for patient confidentiality but this should not preclude clinicians  being able to gather a full picture. "

"Access to Services","Discharge sooner. Hold people for too long. I don't like the system. Compared to other Mental Wards I have been on, there is practically no compromise at Wells Road at all. The Mental Health Act in general is a violation of basic human rights being held against will and injected with dangerous chemicals under law is no different to Nazi Germany which was also legal at the time. I am exclusive of decisions in general, I may as well be a second class citizen.. Although other patients respond well to the medication. I don't I have experienced more negative side effects than any positives, my beliefs remain the same where as now I have to deal with dangerous chemicals."

Waste tax payers money. Decisions go through 10 people. ***** is very patronising.. Lack of care no psychologist for months."

Treated unfairly. The staff prefer to bully me. Never ask me if i'm OK. I've been bullied by the staff. I don't get a choice or a voice."
"Care/ Treatment","Make bigger feedback boxes. Lol!! I am not the National Institute for Clinical Excellence; while it is accepted that medication and secure hospital treatment do treat some cases of illness, there are long term patients that fall through the cracks i.e.PD patients and Chronic Schizophrenics. Meds alone seems to be the policy. Analysis i.e therapy 1:1 is proven to work but as it is time consuming, expensive and variously successful. Its cost effectiveness cannot reliably be estimated (lives improved per "

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff for leave, more activities on ward. "
"Access to Services","The hospital could give individual step by step progress plans to include what is needed before discharge from hospital also what went wrong e.g. what is preventing me from getting discharge and formulate a plan of action to overcome these problems and work towards a successful discharge planner with patient involvement through out all the stages of the plan. 
This service doesn't guarantee anything - it taken too long to progress - Then I experience too many set - backs in my care.. They listen, but are slow to respond.. They communicate well - but do not always solve the problems.. They do what they need to do thats all.. I attend every ward round. Plus I attend the patient forum to discuss ward problem and other hospital and patient problems.. Not enough feedback to the patient"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff so i can have my leave. "

"Access to Services","Don't think you could do anything better. Staff so busy on ???, that don't always have time to see patients."
"Care/ Treatment","CST program was very useful and helped a great deal, however I feel it really needs to be a continuous therapy, something that patients can rely on as a support for as long as it is effective. I feel we are 'in the wilderness' again, alone."

"Access to Services","The service should be provided longer than 12 weeks."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","As discussed, just provide the service - tea, meal. Don't ask because the answer will inevitably be 'no' or 'I will have it later'. 
Always check heating on in cold weather.
Check that bed is made correctly, At mum's stage of dementis it often isn't."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing levels. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Consistent staffing."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Resolutions? Some crap staff."

"Environment/Facilities","More fitness, gynasium ECT "
"Communication","Not listening to what he feels about medication. Better than it was. Skeptical and depends."
"Care/ Treatment","Less restrictions - can be over the top with the restrictions. Be more trusting - sometimes feel like we are being wrapped in cotton. Understand that we do develop friendships and not to read too much into this. I feel that my opinion doesn't matter. I feel that decisions are made without me being present and before speaking with me. NA and SN's opinions don't appear to match that of my RC."
"Care/ Treatment","Seclusion revews:  Why haven't they changed since 1983?   Why do patients/prisoners,  hearing voices that means victims of terrorism, have to be punished because no one not even the State,  for example Action fraud because of identity thefts or Scotland Yard because of terrorism, they can't stop them "" the voices"" how can the patients?   How can you leave them for 5 days under a  bright light like they are in a sun bed, in those we only can be 1/2 hour a day, because of skin cancers.  Breathing the same oxygen for 5 or 6 days, there is no window or take him for fresh air?   Have for example rubber headphones with their music on not to hear so much or so near the voices.   Dimmer lights and an Emergency Talking Therapist after 1 or 2 hours being in seclusion because it's better for them than changing the Medicine.  They need to be cared for and understood, not punished,  entertain them instead.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","It could be better. "
"Care/ Treatment","More activities on the ward. A broken shower has still not been repaired after about 3 months. In the evenings 7.30 - 8.00pm we are given a piece of fruit. I would like a small pack of biscuits to see me through the evening."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff to ensure as to get more time off ward."
"Food","Meals."
"Communication","Our complaints are not been believed and getting thrown out because we have no proof and it is our word against theirs so we are not listened to.

"Involvement","At the ward meetings let us actually make some decisions that would benefit us in a positive way."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Employ more staff. Stop cancelling off ward activities."
"Care/ Treatment","Shut down Rampton. You dislike us patients the service, the building, the habits of staff are proof of it. The service is so poor the rooms are like kennels. The carpets are dusty. My doctor is so stubborn; I tell him my meds are wrong but he refuses to listen. The service has its own interest at heart not mine. Staff sometimes are respectful and disrespectful at other times. Doctors make all the wrong decisions. Patients have to make a wrong practice. The service is supposed to respect my sexuality but the service has made me impotent."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Respect should come both sides and sometimes you have to meet half way. Depending on the individual and if they are learning or not."
"Care/ Treatment","Considering the disability from which I stopped restrictions in participation mean there is insufficient activity. As a patient it feels like i am living the life of a cabbage and many patients have voiced the same opinion.

"Care/ Treatment","""Listen"" and ""Respect"" people and their rights. You ""keep"" & ""punish"" people for being stupid. And I dont think this place is fair. I don't like this hospital and all its silly rules yet now I am poorly none of the rules have been bent for me and I'd call the service I get here at Rampton as emotional torture. I've been here nine years and to be told you're mentally ill when you're not is not nice and that I'd rather be in a prison and i've told everybody, yet they the team here at Rampton don't listen to me, that is obvious! My medication has gone up for no good reason and the Dr has refused to give me the 2nd doctors reasons for recommending my mental health is not fair. If Dr and his managers had any respect for me they would have sent me back to prison by now as I am really struggling with the routine here at Rampton. My medication has gone up but the doctor won't give me the 2nd opinions doctors reasons.. Been made to sit and eat with people for 4 1/2 hours per day is very bad for my well-being."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing. There are sometimes lapses in communication."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","When we say we gonna do something do it!

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Stop moving staff."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff would provide a more concise activity facilities, but that's a major issue across the board. This is dependent on what and whom. Psychology etc is BAD as they are too fixed on their own views. Sometimes communication breaks down when various areas/depts are involved.  Rarely does the patient get asked or have input."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything."
"Food","Food-care- the way you treat patients the way staff treat patients."

"Care/ Treatment","Better staff attitude towards patients sometimes. - React better to conflict on wards. - Place less judgments on situations and go on facts."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Everything. Most staff don't have the time for me. I get no say. Some staff nurses are too young and in-experienced."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Make sure that there is enough staff to run activities and stop giving all cheviot staff away, because when you come from prison it does not give you confidence for your future here. It sometimes takes weeks to get information I want."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Less short staff issues so activities don't get cancelled."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff and help people move on."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff the wards properly."
"Care/ Treatment","Get gym on regular."
"Care/ Treatment","Where do I start. Hate Rampton. Poor marking is modern matron. I've been in Rampton 12 years and its always been ****."
"Access to Services","Pay a better wage so staff stay. Messages often get forgotten due to short staff so they are that busy they forget. "
"Care/ Treatment","More stuff on the wards."
"Care/ Treatment","More structured routines. More creative therapy instead of releiving an DBT & DBT RO. Not treating each patient the same as the next (tailor individual treatments.) More cost saving ventures and sell thing made in house become more independent not reli. When things are up to numbers the commitments to try new things is a hope for the future of Rampton. They believe they are always correct and they know better than us patients some times this is the case but not always. They can't/don't understand me or can't read me or don't care. Hidden comment (hiding behind a smile). Not very good at listening, not very good at time keeping, not very good at feeding back relevant info."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Change is the entire system as is dog eat dog, staff a majority are bullys to staff who care and the patient who prove them wrong and do well. No one cares. Patient don't matter nor some staff. It gives but then takes away."
"Food","Don't know / food."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff to carry out activities. We have a shortage of staff that can sometimes lead to a breakdown in prompt responses."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff try but are limited in their help due to shortages and no time."
"Communication","Talk about the future more."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, bigger rooms for groups, better time on wards so we phone."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff. Menu's for food doesn't always come down."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff. When staff become stressed they are not so good at being supportive. Offer more activities, groups, therapies. "
"Care/ Treatment","It's so strict it hurts. We are carted about like cattle, treated like where in the army and talked down to.."
"Care/ Treatment","Visits with family & friends should be easier to book. Visitor should phone reception and they send out 3 letters to ward, visitor and patient. Then visitor should bring their letter to reception and they wont be let in without it. 
Staff treat pts badly locking them in rooms 24/7 given no fresh air or exercise.. Ask for something and given something else.. Say things will change then they don't.. Don't always get fed or drinks given.. Care plans are just written for you. No input.. Not enough psychological treatments/therapies. Not enough gym."
"Privacy and Dignity","Dignity - once when I was unwell I stripped down naked and then held me in seclusion when I was naked I think it was wrong. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff on Ruby. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Improve service for women with hearing impairments. Due to being deaf in both ears I find it hard understanding communications."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More talkative to patients - quality not brief ones. More staff on wards. 
Food terrible and ward noisy at night. Medication gives me bowel problems..
I don't feel included staff/patient divide.
Because when moved from Emerald no discussion as to why move was happening.. I was young when I came to this hospital. I was young and I found it sedentary and sat down for long periods of time and found very little to occupy my time."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff the wards better. Stop moving the TIW'S as they offer a good service and really help me, but they are constantly moved. 
Depends on how many staff as to what care you get."
"Care/ Treatment","Because some staff call me a selfish and evil person."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything. Never enough staff to staff the ward so we as patients loose out on services."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing levels "
"Care/ Treatment","More activities but apart from that nothing else. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More 1 to 1 interaction needed between qualified staff nurses & clients. Only real contact I had was when I received medication.  Staff spent all their day in the office. I'm sure doing documentation but this is not nursing in my opinion. Need more sessions over the weekend.  More counselling type sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","Community meetings facilitated by staff so people can share positive and negative experiences. "
"Food","Better meals and able to have mobile phone. "
"Care/ Treatment","More activities/diverse daily plan structure to relieve boredom."
"Environment/Facilities","Get a pool"
"Communication","Als allow more time outside.  Listen to me about medication etc.  More involved with making decision of what I want. "
"Involvement","Info on website needs to be up to date and accurate (I can cover this).  Activities, at least have some.  Maybe consider days out to the park or other cheap alternative.  Discuss Treatment plans with patients & make them aware they can with staff. Have induction ceremony for new patients, scrap xxx inspections, perhaps introduce a buddy system.  Better budget control, necessary wastage of electricity water and food. Install cooking facilities so clients can cook own meals.  Talking therapies and therapeutic intervention invite other groups in apart from AA which is not everyone's cup of tea.  Improve on counter espionage perhaps set up an anti infiltration. "

The mental health team were great, the GP were different even with documented evidence of illness he still treat you like a liar. 
No interaction between Mental Health & GP nothing has changed.  The GP hurt my feelings badly and I struggle not to hurt myself (or worse).  Not a day goes by when I don't thin about ending it. "

"Access to Services","Have more access to physio's.  "
"Food","Provide coffee.  "

"Care/ Treatment","Offer things like gym sessions and holistic therapy to help depression and being involved in different stuff to interact with others. "

Sometimes they do not do positive things to better your well-being, they make things worse."
"Access to Services","Weekend cover would be great benefit where physical complications/ailments were of an urgent nature.                                                                                                   "

"Care/ Treatment","Help me get my medication I was prescribed before. Nothing else.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Believe and listen to folk not everyone is a liar in here and sometimes we do know what we're on about. When your prescribed meds by a doctor on road because you need these meds then a doctor in here looks you up and down and drops your meds and you have to take pain killers when you say not when you need them and go without pain relief for 14 to 16 hours.  It is a myth that prisons have the same health care as the public, if I had an asthma attack I'd be dead no one answers cell bell and if I need to us my inhalers more because I'm struggling to breath I can't have ???????.  The doctor has took one look at me has lowered the strength of my antibiotics which Kings Mill has just prescribed me. You think everyone's lying you do not listen to us at all.  We tell you we've been through things before and it didn't work you go ahead anyway like we're lying you believe nothing we say not everyone is a liar.  I see lads as well myself who need certain meds but cannot yet them. then lads who are lying are on these meds or treatments that don't need them or never have. Some look at you and talk to yo like your dirt (not all) their rough with you ad listen to nowt you say.  They just do it even when you say it was tried before and made things worse.  Some people do not care if you died in front of them."
"Care/ Treatment","I believe if you were to improve, you would have to look & treat people quicker depending on circumstances and if you are on medication outside you should get it on arrival. It took me 48 hrs to get my Methadone & 2 weeks for my Levetricatam (epilepsy Meds), Which effected me really bad I fitted nearly every day, so I was really let down with the services. I put in several app's & spoke to nurses everyday it still took 2 weeks.  I was put in a high risk situation due to my epilepsy & being on a drug wing."

"Access to Services","Waiting time too long for GP."
"Access to Services","Sometimes long waiting list causing problems."
"Access to Services","See you sooner."
"Care/ Treatment","Everything. Most of the time I'm not informed of appointments. Then when I do get to see someone they are rude and think you are trying to pull a fast one. Medication is often missing and I have to go without, even though I've had to queue for half an hour to get them. 
It takes months to see anyone and they you are seen to be lying to get what you want eg time off work or drugs etc. I waited 8 weeks to see mental health whilst suffering from PTSD and was told I was wasting time because the episode was over when I did get to see them.
I often miss appointments because I don't know I have them. The receptionists are often rude and you aren't told what's happening with my treatment.
It actually makes you worse worrying that you won't get treated if something happens whilst I'm here."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything.
Don't listen to our problems. 
Listening good, do poor.
Telling you ok, but don't stick to plan.

Waiting time.
"
"Access to Services","Get us to see the Doc a lot quicker. "
"Communication","Make sure people are aware of appointments in advance. Make sure doctors are in agreement with patients about their problem. Listen to patients more. 
Some nurses chose to ignore me when I stated I had chest pain.
Couldn't understand Doctor/Language barrier.
Some staff seemed judgemental.
I never got to say what I wanted to happen at appointments.
Not seeing doctor so regularly so I was stuck on medication that didn't help."

Do things right and don't wait till meds run out before ordering."

"
"Access to Services","Make getting seen faster. Took months to get to see Doctor and dentist."
"Access to Services","Waiting time. Consideration of patients. Very little done well."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything apart from substance misuse is ****. Been waiting for 12 months to see a dentist. I came into prison with a broken ??? c1. I still haven't received pain killers or seen a doctor 12 monts later."
"Communication","Maybe look at what prescription drugs people are on and why, and try to look at a more holistic approach to some of those cases.
Could inform us of other treatments that don't involve medication.
Not enough signposting to holistic treatments."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt that more time could have been given.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I think it needs to be much more organised and a lot quicker!! I can never get to speak to a doctor/nurse, the one nurse I've spoken too listened well but has done nothing yet. She didn't really show any respect, she just listened to what I said then booked an appointment which I still haven't had!!!! I've had no treatment yet!!!"
"Communication","Get things right. Not listening to my worker. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything"
"Communication","Have asked doctor for help with meds! basically didn't listen. "
"Care/ Treatment","Give me my tablets when I came into prison even if it show's there is nowt in you ??? but after doctor tell's you once they get conformation they would give me my meds. I came in on ??? and then was told I was not going to get them. No matter how many times you put appointments in they will always put you back here within 2 days. I would not go back to the Barnsley Drug workers.  I am still buying ??? to keep me going. "
"Access to Services","Employ more staff.  Take less care of drug addicts and pay more attention to genuine users.  Never used your services as the waiting list was too long and I was better by the time I was seen.  They don't really listen as everybody nags at them so goes in 1 ear and out of the other.  Normal people get less treatment than addicts.  Slow responses get treated as though your an addict.  You get shown respect if your on horion.  Never actually been seen by a doctor as the waiting list is weeks long. "
"Communication","Listen to me more."
"Care/ Treatment","Medication. Can never speak to nurse.  I can't get a choice.  "
"Communication","More information"
"Access to Services","Waiting list dentist. "
"Care/ Treatment","Don't forget lads when they come in even if the are on med's that you get conformation and still don't give them their med's once they give a clear xxx test. 
I had to do my rattle myself.  They tell you what you want to hear. I got my med's stopped for nowt. "
"Access to Services","Maybe have seen me sooner and have given my main amount after first day. "
"Care/ Treatment","Medication - more understanding needs/correct medication when needed. 
Took 1 week to get mouth was! Still not on correct medication - Anti-biotics.
Good at listening to what people have to say - but response is poor.
Not always treated with respect.  Do what they feel like - take matters out of my hands. 
Still waiting for treatment even though I've had an operation - jaw/tooth removal.

"Communication","Keep the patient more informed about any news."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Nothing, bur for support to be available daily."
"Care/ Treatment","If there could be more appointment time it would be better.  I know I benefit so much after my appointments but sometimes I feel frustrated and let down when I can't see XXXX when I feel down & vulnerable when she's not here. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More mental health staff"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, quicker service."
"Access to Services","Set up further courses to help with conditions or disabilities which will help on release."
"Access to Services","Reduce waiting times for dentist and doctor. "
"Smoking","The prison service needs to enforce the rules and STOP people smoking in the health center waiting room. I am a cancer survivor and making me sit in that room which reeks of smoke is a violation of my legal rights and a serious danger to my health and effectively discriminates against me. Physical health needs let you down e.g. getting plasters and antiseptic. Dispensing staff are defensive and resistant."
"Communication","More notice of appointments and there purpose."
"Access to Services","I've been her since Xmas and am still waiting to see some who can help mas as my case is to difficult they are still waiting for someone qualified to deal with me. 
They could involve us more in our treatment ask our opinions more.

Some appointments were cancelled do staff shortages."
"Access to Services","I guess to get seen quicker"
"Care/ Treatment","Actually give me some help/re-prescribe my previous medication, I'm in the most stressful time of my life, and after a meeting with your team I felt worse than ever!  I have received no medication at all I'm angry, frustrated, stress, depressed when can I receive my medication is all I want to know I have not been sleeping properly at all. There was no response to what I said at all I said I felt so  bad I felt suicidal and the outcome was to wait another 2 weeks or more this makes me extremely sad, depressed, with a desperate way to end this. There was no progress form my meeting, I feel angry that I have been here for over 2 months & your sending me letters telling me to wait & que position so I have to suffer while you are happy etc.. very sad. i feel very emotional unfortunately it's not the emotions I want I'm very sad nothing has changed sine my visit I'm not in a position where I can wait to be seen again. The next time I'm seen , there will be an outburst because I feel like your taking the xxx out of me sending me this when I'm still waiting for basic any kind of medication.  Extremely poor, if there was more categories past poor I would choose them because this is ridiculous to ask me this considering you are making my life more difficult! terrible."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To do a proper job for start. I have medication papers by the doctor won't prescribe my meds in this prison. I have a Chronic back condition.
Unwilling to help us in any way.

He didn't take notice.
I have had my condition for years. I live with it but wouldn't listen to my opinion.
I'm in agony not getting proper pain meds or sleep."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","You could have more qualified people working in the medication dispensary. If meds are changed (or similar) they never seem to know anything or want to know how to help or find out."
"Care/ Treatment","It has been 2 weeks now & I still have not received my medication that I have been on 4 the last 7 yrs now (penicillin) & have had ???? like I was a kid & have had none of them issued tome.  I need my penicillin as I have no spline so I'm prone to infections, cold, ????

"Access to Services","Seen more often and shorter waiting times."
"Care/ Treatment","Treat/Get me the medication I should and have been prescribed on the out as i'm a prisoner at HMP Lincoln at the moment. I'm still waiting for the rest of my medication after 3 weeks.  Still waiting for a GP/Physiologist appointment. The system in HMP Prisons is very poor. The staff are nice and helpful but the only thing the can do is listen and talk.  "
"Access to Services","Maybe get seen a bit faster. "
"Access to Services","See people quicker"
"Access to Services","Waiting time once down at healthcare."
"Access to Services","Reduce waiting time. I sat on a trolley from 9am till 10pm when a bed was found. It was agony."

"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes reminded we are in prison and tarnished/painted with the same brush.  
Communication - Seems a one way system which works?"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Try to understand the frustration we feel when we dont know how long we will have to spend in an immigration detention centre."
"Care/ Treatment","If you could help with medical justice or referrals of that kind, it might be of great help to me and maybe other service users.
The methods or means I have previously used were/are maintained. Could have been better with something new maybe.
Hope I could get more directive on how to deal with my mental health issues. "
"Care/ Treatment","Attention on people we need care than anybody else. You are taking care well but need more.
Some service needs 50 be provide to.  Communication - because it's necessary our point of view.  
I wish if you could really make sure for night service.  "
"Care/ Treatment","I feel like though the person I saw knows what they are doing but they seem kind of limited in making helpful decisions.They did listen pretty well and understood the problem  but solutions was kind of postponed. "

"Communication","Communication between the team and with patients. Consistency. Following up with what is planned on happening actually happening. It is hard to trust in a service if this doesn't happen. Having a meal planner that corresponds to the food in that week. I did not feel listened to and heard by the consultant. When I was supported in meetings this was by external people involved in my care and not by ward staff."
"Environment/Facilities","Can we have hookers in the rooms please, thing get lost a lot mixing with clothes. "

"Care/ Treatment","I was upset 'refused' had been put on my 517 form. Have agreed plan of how to improve this with my ward manager."

"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes when calling up the person would make unhelpful comments and I felt like there wasn't much compassion."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More signs to help us know where to go.
Staff to be more welcome and friendly.
Waiting room to be more friendly towards those with social anxiety.
Better reading material in the waiting room?

"Communication","Would like staff higher sign level, 4 or more."
"Care/ Treatment","Help and support people with Mental Health by giving guide back to employment/education.
"
"Communication","Listen to patient needs/wants paint & suffering. You people at the top are xxx at your job. "

"Communication","Listen.  Every time I have tried to provide insight into my family's home life I get interrupted even though I'm THE CARER which is kinda like a ""mom""."

"Care/ Treatment","Provide better activities for patients.  Engage with patients more by offering different options of things to do.  Provide actual counselling sessions.  maybe group sessions?"
"Communication","I've written a few of these but i is only because of the horrendous experience  I have had. I intend to write up a formal complain, however I do want to re-iterate that the staff are mostly impatient, unwilling to really listen."
"Communication","Listen with patience. The lovely women who have been brought into this ward have more going on in their heads than medication can fix. I've been here just over 1 week and have not been offered any kind of counselling. The staff try but often seem to lack the time to be able to counsel appropriately."
"Communication","Again, listen. I tried to tell staff that I was concerned about my body. I wanted to appeal the section-2 decision and was told that I need to stop. X from the night staff was completely rude and lacked any kind of patience."

"Care/ Treatment","More funding is needed to provide earlier intervention to prevent getting to crisis point. Patients need to stop being passed around in circles as this creates a negative affect on a persons mental health, adding to distress. Better communciation between professionals rather than relying on the patient or carer. Less waiting times for therapies - in 7 years under CMHT never been accepted for any therapies and the one i have, it has now been 2 years since referral, 18 months since assessment and 13 months since placed on a 6-9 month waiting list. Still waiting."
"Communication","Should be listening to people about their mental wellbeing instead of saying you have the mental capacity, then when something happens it won't happen again but it does and you backs are covered. I want and will die because the lord is preparing a room in his mansion for me very soon, so 3 children will be left motherless. "
"Care/ Treatment","when a hospital professional refers someone with severe anxiety symptoms that raised his heart rate dangerously high and put him in a catatonic state (mute, completely rigid and unable to respond do not dismiss it all as being irrelevant and decide as a support worker (probably with NVQ level 1 that you know better than a senior paramedic, experienced ambulance crew, doctor in charge at A&E and an excellent mental health professional who got my son talking, calmed him down and referred him to your service in the expectation he would get the help he needed. Also just because the patient does not have any history of mental illness on the system doesn't mean he hasn't if he has been reluctant to go to the doctor to discuss things. Support worker X did not even know my son's age so had obviously not read the report from the mental health professional at the hospital.  She talked to me like I had low intelligence when I tried to talk about previous problems he had.  Naturally she was respecting his privacy but shouldn't a professional have told me she couldn't discuss it with me due to patient confidentiality!! It also obviously did not occur to her that my son might be intelligent enough to mask his symptoms again it appears a lack of professional training. She left repeatedly thanking me for the nice cup of tea! (made for her and colleague to hopefully create a relaxed atmosphere to get my son talking in the garden with them as he requested. She left details of a counselling service with him and said that some people just don't want to talk maybe he will when he's 30! Very useful!! There must surely be other support (from a professional other than counselling that my son has already rejected.  My son stayed out all night and was throwing things around in his room this morning, but he doesn't need any support according to Jo!"

"Smoking","Ban smoking even outside"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Complaint services. Some staff listen more than others."
"Care/ Treatment","Teach skills in a better way so they are more understanding. Acknowledge our feelings. Tell us what we have to do to move forward instead of letting us figure it out for ourselves. Support: Don't get told much about my care and I only get communicated to when being told off. Polite: I just get told what to do. Feel like im being helped."
"Care/ Treatment","Be less reminded about rules. Give support, watch over us. Staff do there best to help. As some staff show less respect at times. Things get done without us there."
"Care/ Treatment","Reduce restrictive practices, Increase access to healthy lifestyle activities - both on and off ward. A lack of consistency between staff creates uncertainty between patients and some ward rules serve to create an abrasive ethos rather than encourage us to work together. I am left feeling that I am the last to find out. I feel more could be done on ward like better time accessing courtyard and planned exercise activities, ward access to field walks and maybe excersise equipment provided along with space to participate."

Ensure structured day takes place. Give us more gym sessions. Communication. Sometimes not everything is communicated until its too late. I am informed about what is going on every 2 weeks via ward round. Sometimes decisions are made without your input whatsoever. Because when short staffed groups get cancelled which affects peoples emotional well-being."
"Care/ Treatment","less rules and more duty of care."
"Involvement","Stop putting patient on treatment groups time and time again, and you need to let patients have a better say on the treatment they need."
"Care/ Treatment","Everything non clinical. Letting peers have a better independence. Ban all blanket bans. Move from the 1980's to the 21st Century. Clinical matters, i.e. PHC. It could be better on many levels. Sometimes you get the balance just right then you switch off. Some staff always treat you as equals others draw a line in the sand and see us as offenders. I have no comment to make. I have much decisions and they are currently being used. Because so much has changed in the way services are delivered since I came here."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Be more professional."
"Food","Meals."
"Care/ Treatment","Improve structured day activities give out mini satisfaction surveys more often because this could be to identify."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Appropriate staff or better utilisation of resources e.g. more staff in morning shift compared to evening shift etc. Speedy recovery to be offered to well patients. More and quick leave for patients which will help to progress from escorted to unescorted leave. Listen to feedback given by patients regarding therapeutic groups. MDT should involve patients in decision making and should respect their requests. Weekly MDT to expedite recovery and leave and trust in patients and involve them in their care and decisions. Lack of staff causes cancellations of many therapeutic activities and slows down progress and recovery. None of our suggestions related to treatment groups are taken into consideration. Decisions are communicated late and often after they are made without patient involvement. I have to eat on the table with colleagues who eat meat. I am a vegetarian and I am not allowed to cook my meals more than twice a month. Services here involve us in decision making about care or our treatment. lack of staff causes cancellations of therapeutic leaves. No activities on weekends make it extremely boring. Consultants do not attend wards on daily basis. When staff is adequate or there is 1 extra staff on shift it makes all the difference - patients can go out on leave, play and do activities, time for 1:1 sessions.  CPA care plan copy is given regularly for records and progress. It has taken a lot of effort to fill this form and put reasons and comments hence please take it seriously and act on it immediately for the benefits of patients and staff. "

I came to see my relative (been visiting now everyday for 2 weeks) staff brought me wrong patient!!! Visiting room is awful, chairs are awful, family visiting room has NO facilities at all.  Have to keep asking staff to let us out to go to the toilets & make drinks.  Staff wouldn't have noticed if I brought my relative home! Staff are friendly but service is rubbish!"
"Care/ Treatment","Probably give more help and information when you first go in because you can feel frightened and lonely and rather lost.  There is often a stigma with Mental Illness due to all the fear around it.

"Care/ Treatment","Probably give more help and information when you first go in because you can feel frightened and lonely and lost."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There should be more fairness from staff towards patients. Not favour one or two and leave the others. When you ask something and are told by staff they will do it, it should be done, not forgotten about or ignored. I just don't think it is fair to people who are poorly or cannot defend themselves. People talk over you as if you are not there."

She has not had any hormones yet after 4 years. You should be ashamed!!! My poor girl is looking more and more male cause you can't be bothered. She lives a miserable existence trying to shave her body constantly and dealing with constant eczema because of it. No wonder the poor kid can't get a job. I'm sick of seeing what emotional agony she goes through every time she walks out the door!!  Luckily she's sociable and has friends who keep her strong.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Improve staffing levels. Train staff not to cover for each other. Less patronising.
Overall, the service is poor because there is never any change, staffing levels are too low and the staff that are around lack the commitment to want to help. However, when patients request changes to be made they rarely are. Staff are pleasant enough and make themselves clear, but are also generally very patronising. I frequently hear staff talk about me in a unsettling manner and they put their own conversation before patient requests.  I am always able to express my opinion, but it is rarely listened to. I am always able to express my opinion, but it is rarely listened too."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff to talk to but apart from that amazing.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Have nurses/healthcare assistants around the ward more rather than in the office, as sometimes you feel like too much of a bother knocking on the office door just to have someone to talk to.

Also referral appt to take 2-3 weeks after suicide thoughts - this is not quick enough when dealing with Mental Health issues. CRSIS team should also speak to/listen to family if attending the assessment- sometimes patients don't tell the whole story/truth. "
"Care/ Treatment","Maybe give more an accurate time. "
"Care/ Treatment","I would have liked to have seen the psychiatrist again, once more, before discharge.  "

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more available time for 1-1."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff so more availability."
"Access to Services","I know services are stretched and can be difficult to gain access to promptly. As a male with mental health difficulties at times I find it hard to ask for help until very unwell, during my recent illness I was referred via occupational health just days before Christmas 2016, I received a phone call next day from the Hope Centre and given support numbers for the holiday week period which I used on one occasion but it was good to have these.  Regarding the question sometimes appointments were weeks apart and it would have been better to have them closer."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More consistency with people who visit - understand this can be difficult due to working/shift patterns."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","For home visits, it would be nice if they were longer to give you more chances to discuss any difficulties form the last week (or since you were last seen)."

I felt useless because I felt I wasn't helping her."

"Communication","Talk more to patients. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Talk to patients a bit more. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Receptionists who actually alert staff to your presence in timely matter. I was once 30 mins late for therapy session because receptionist forgot to let therapist know I had arrived and therapist presumed I wasn't coming. Generic crisis team staff need training on dissociative disorders. It's not acceptable that i or other patients come to crisis team for support to manage crisis and the staff have no better suggestions than cook or go for a walk - when they've just been told that it is unsafe for patient to do either of those things due to dissociation."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything. Service abysmal. Unprofessional. Uncaring. This was not nursing, but poorly trained people with a  superior, judgemental attitude completing a raft of tick sheets and forms. Interested ONLY in how to get rid of the ""problem"" (patient) to somewhere else. Poor communication - consultant went on holiday and suddenly inpatient admission is no longer required - can the patient nip along to have a chat in a group every day.  Staff were ALWAYS late by hours usually without notification.  Staff were angry that patient wanted me present.  They did not listen to him or me.  Persevered on topics they thought important, like how much coke a suicidal person was drinking. Made complaint - nothing.  Ridiculous. No compassion, no kindness, no interest.  The early interventions team were so patronising it was embarrassing.  The nurses have no insight into their attitudes.  They treated us in a way that if we didn't agree with their pronouncements then we were fools or stupid and somehow trouble makers undeserving of help.  There was no clinical skill in evidence other than from the consultant seen on that one occasion. It was heartbreaking actually."
"Care/ Treatment","Didn't like putting weight on with medication."
"Care/ Treatment","Time to relax"
"Care/ Treatment","Activities. "

"Access to Services","Sometimes my appointment did not start on time. "
"Access to Services","Waiting lists1"
"Care/ Treatment","More appointments"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More support for parents.  All posters in reception are out of date.  Feel very isolates.  Understand center are very stretched but need more appointments & out of hours support.  Took us 4 months to get proper appointment by which time  daughter had got worse.  Felt could have been nipped in the bud earlier. the progress has been ???? don't know when things will improve."
"Care/ Treatment","Session with parents without child at outset."
"Care/ Treatment","More consistency.  Appointments on time.  Staff not changing. "
"Access to Services","Quicker referrals - ie. more funding for ALL Mental Health services. "
"Care/ Treatment","We asked for a family session so whatever advice our child was taking on board we could put in the context of our family.  I thing that this should be offered, initially to make impact sustainable over time. "
"Care/ Treatment","More toys in rooms."
"Access to Services","More sessions please."
"Care/ Treatment","Talk about yourself before asking loads of questions about the patient so they feel not so pressured. "
"Care/ Treatment","The sheets they give you could be a bit better. "

"Access to Services","Maybe a workshop with people of the same conditions?"
"Access to Services","Get access to place quicker"
"Environment/Facilities","Have some toys"
"Care/ Treatment","Make people speak more about themselves."
"Care/ Treatment","More confidence skills"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Once Maria got involved our care and circumstances improved Immediately! Before this we seemed to be getting nowhere fast we and no worker or nurse, no diagnosis and my child was extremely Ill and there was no support, help or information! It was an extremely scary time!."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The crisis team were at the least neglectful, non-informative and came across with little or no empathy.  It almost felt that they were not interested and did not want to except or deal with the situation.  On a 'non client"
"Access to Services","Make the service easier to access more out of hours services in crisis."
"Access to Services","We had to wait a long time to see Phil & Joy"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","CAMHS in own area could be more supportive. "
"Communication","Store patient in formation on a control portable database that can be added to by each healthcare professional during the patient's say, rather than each one taking their own notes every time."
"Access to Services","Waiting time to improve. "
"Communication","Not expect the child or person who they are talking to, to let it all out and explain everything in details.  Feels like they pressure you to keep talking when you clearly don't want too.  "
"Access to Services","The service should be 24 hour. "
"Access to Services","This service needs to continue at Kingsmill and not at Lindsay Close. This service needs to be 24 hours or at least extended hours (not 9-5).  More money needs to be invested in ALL areas of Mental Health."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Be more upbeat so it doesn't feel so morbid."
"Environment/Facilities","Cafe.  More time. "
"Communication","Talk to patients more. Don't ask how you're feeling."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More leave. Some members of staff can be difficult to get alone with. "
"Care/ Treatment","Work harder with patients. "
"Leave","Give more leave. 
Service - not good.  I don't feel listened too. No respect. No difference in health and well being. "
"Communication","When I was first on the wait list I was missed off the keep in touch session and this was distressing.  How about sending a text every month to let us know that we are still in the system and inpatient. Shame the waiting list is so long. "
"Access to Services","Not leaving it too long between groups."
"Access to Services","More funding, shorter waiting lists, more frequent appointments.  Waited very long time at each stage (first appointment, first course, second course each 9 months, 18 months etc). I feel waiting times are really letting patients down and causing may to give up, self harm or attempt suicide. A lot more funding is needed to improve the service and the accessibility. Message often didn't get passed on by reception so calls back didn't happen and required several attempts to reach the person. I felt involved but a lot was out of my hands regarding waiting times, appointment and courses."
"Care/ Treatment","Let me go to the next place. "
"Care/ Treatment","Don't punish us for our mental health Dr for our behaviors as lone as its only causing harm to ourselves and not hurt others. You do listen but you don't always act. There is OK communication but sometimes there is things that are not handed over or things can change without letting us know. Respect-improvements could be made. You do many things right but things could be approved on everything you do. "
"Communication","Communication.
Language used?(stupid)
Please talk in English?
Sometimes there is mis-communications.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything. I'm not suppose to be her. Every time I talk they tell me to shut up or take me to low esteem. I'm just bully.  they don't listen to me.  They decide things about me.  I don't get no h?? with my legs (mobility problems)."

"Food","Foot not as good as Arnold Lodge."
"Care/ Treatment","The people that are well should have more OT sessions for staying out of trouble. "
"Care/ Treatment","Give us more freedom.  It seems that you have your favorites and those that don't comply find it difficult to get leave. You tend to patronize us when we are telling the truth.  When we knock at the door to get deodorant and after shave you take to much time over responding. When your parents don't understand you give them excuses.  I'm health anyway and I'm getting treatment for nothing when I'm fit enough already."
"Communication","Extremely likely fells like he his getting know were.  
Communicating - poor even poor dope ahale. 
Involving - very poor unknown objects."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Let you our faster, not keep us so long. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","HCA members could engage a little bit more with patient heads not just using ???? and ???? ???.

"Service Quality/Outcomes","???? is a few male and female that ??? is Kayley scared of with stripping ??? on several occasion it give ???? of my self to be at risk and ??? to to home as soon as possible be discharged from ???? ??? ??? ???"
"Involvement","1.Exterior bell is rarely answered by Cherry Ward staff. 
2. Has a husband of I would have liked to have been involved with my wife's care plan earlier on rather than rubber stamp it some weeks later.
3. Not leave my wife unwashed till 3rd day (she had started to smell badly)."
"Access to Services","Earlier referral to service, all staff, ??? based, nurse very helpful."
"Access to Services","From being referred by her doctor, we have yet to be told the outcome of the memory clinics doctors visit to my friends home.  She had an ECG which was asked for by them.  The waiting time after original assessment seems to be very long (several months). We have only had contact with on doctor? on her visit to assess my friend.  No other contact has been made.  The doctor we saw was kind, and pleasant, but was late & hadn't had chance to look at my friends paperwork & circumstance. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","After seeing two mental health nurses who did not feel helpful at all I finally met a brilliant one whose praises I cannot give highly enough.  Managing the previous two is a training issue. "
"Communication","Be more open about what is available eg ??? ??? skills are not??? to the first ?? ??? eg OT, Speech + Language, ??? et al."
"Food","We know it is difficult but possibly the food. "
"Care/ Treatment","The social contact with others was good and could be promoted more. "
"Care/ Treatment","Would like a bit more activity."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I'm pretty sure I've already filled on of these forms in. "
"Communication","You may already speak to school groups, if not they are pretty wise at noticing problems at home. A number to ring might induce them to ask for help. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More volunteers to spend time with patients, take them to the coffee shop or a short walk."
"Care/ Treatment","Come later in the morning. 
Nothing wrong with the service."
"Care/ Treatment","Come later in morning"
"Access to Services","I can't think of anything you could have improved on.  The service was everything I could have wished for and more.  The only comment I would make is that it would be appreciated if the service could last longer and the visits reduced more gradually."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Perhaps if funds allow to increase the number of people in the team so that more help could be available to help more people and prevent the current team from too great a workload and the resulting pressure and stress."
"Access to Services","Had to wait a long time for appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","I have a memory problem.  The treatment I received was investigative and I was somewhat surprised at the procedures used. As to what could have been done better, better than what?  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am hard of hearing with 2 hearing aids."
"Access to Services","Keep coming for a bit longer"
"Care/ Treatment","Give me more time to get up. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Maybe a doctor visiting once."
"Access to Services","Had a long wait for appointment. "
"Care/ Treatment","Undertake ECG's within community hospital as part of initial visit rather than referral to GP which had to be chased by carer.  Results could be shared with GP for their professional input in the case."
"Access to Services","Make this service available to more carers. "
"Access to Services","Make longer. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Extremely likely."
"Food","Serve lunch. "
"Access to Services","Have more sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","More session available. "

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more staff so they can provide more home visits to give ongoing support, rather than being limited to a set number for visits."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Sometimes nursing staff are rude. 
They are sometimes too busy in the ward to listen to me. It can be noisy too."
"Access to Services","Because it is a high secure hospital some families find it hard to visitors the cost put some families off. 
Whilst in segregation I found it difficult to mix with others."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I just don't like it here myself."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Show respect - Sometimes they can be.  Had problems in the past with the doctors.  Didn't get on with them.
Not attended ward round for 7 months when on segregation.  Sometimes don't always get a choice.
Talk about medication - NO.  Don't know why I take it.  I am forced to take meds.  
Service - I wouldn't want them to come but I would recommend it. "
"Care/ Treatment","I take meds but they don't really ask me.  it's for schizophrenia & I feel better on medication. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Make me feel better - I still fee the same as when first admitted.
Recommend F&F - don't do a lot with you. slow process. "
"Access to Services","I would rather be somewhere else (in the south) I have had a lot of trouble since I've been here.
Listen - sometimes they do but other times when you are doing something wrong the staff won't talk to you - but if you co-operate they do.  
The staff say I don't need a care plan.  I would like to but when I ask for one to be put in place they don't do it."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not helped me with my anger management.  Sometimes they are too busy taking to others to listen, sometimes they do. They never ask me to talk about things, I just get on with. don't understand why I need to be on some medication. "
"Care/ Treatment","Recommend F&F - They don't need to come here. "
"Communication","Listen - sometimes they can't hear want you are asking them. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","They need more staff to run the place."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff - short staffed most of the time - makes it harder to go to Southwell Day centre - Drop in at Rec Hall - on Sunday.
You get what you are entitled to, but have to wait. "
"Leave","More fresh air more walks in the open. More gym equipment. Squatting/bench pressing. Kept in my room away from activities going on for a long time.

Inadequate CQC remains applicable.  Information feedback in non existent. 
No respect.  Top down management no ??????ment to managers who have respect!!!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Retain more staff which would assist with patients having.  Quality time for rehabilitation courses.  Functions to attend without any cancellations due to lack of staffing levels.  Bring back the LEAD for staff.  No support.  True experience from working.  Incompetent managers.  As viewed from the CQC's.  Manager do not show respect to other staff who work directly with patients. Lack of imput from the management structure. "
"Communication","Would like doctors and nurses reason and understand better be on patients side of things. Could be a lot better. Don't communicate with you. Sometimes doctors can be stubborn - don't understand the side effects."
"Care/ Treatment","Arrange more off ward activities. Healthy diet choice. More sports. Playing indoor games on ward. More therapy and education. 
Some staff don't socialise, though."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Staff helping me. They give me more treatment in Rampton."
"Access to Services","Open more. "
"Access to Services","Open more often eg Chiltern.  Service is adequate but needs improvement. Keep promising a bowling green so older patients have activity to do but still ain't got one. don't pass on messages to patients.  Some good some bad staff.  They tell you whats going on and that's it.  Try to help. "
"Access to Services","Speed up the moving on process after therapy.  "
"Access to Services","Open Chiltern more often.  More TWI staff. "
"Communication","I feel there needs to be more stuff as there is none/not enough to do much activities. The service is fair because I feel it depends whom you are to whether you get treated fair. I feel when staff listen feel they listen and a lot of the time they worry about their next break. I'd rather know more about my pathway to recovery. Sometimes this can be quit rubbish - respect.  Involving - this could be more of an improvement.  lack activities."

I feel ??? I'm listened to by the staff. "

"Involvement","Consultants should put you on a more clear path and remind you of path out! Rather that just be a detention centre with no date of release. The treatment and service is unnecessary and frustrating to be involve with. Fair isn't the right word because other may get more attention than yourself and feel swept under the carpet. Things in your care are decide for yourself rather than what I want. "
"Care/ Treatment","""Management is shit"". - Higher Management. They think they know what is going on, on the wards but don't really have a clue."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff, more doctors, more mangers to come on the ward to see what we are like. Staff winding me up. If I don't eat for week I am force fed which I don't like."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything."
"Care/ Treatment","Good treatment if well behaved and would recommend. Staff could be a bit kinder when you are not well and behaving badly. CQC rules have now gone a bit anal."
"Communication","Don't always tell us why we're in the wrong. Don't tell us why, don't tell us when we get IRI's etc. Don't inform us on any new information - very poor at informing us stuff. Certain people are great while others take the mick, and wind us up, and call us names that are hurtful or not nice and laugh at us, and act like it's all a joke, but I don't find it funny."
"Access to Services","My Dr to see me more often. (Currently once a month). They make a decision about my treatment but don't tell me. That responsibility is passed down the line. They show me respect when they have to (eg. when we have visitors) but not always. Someone winds me up."
"Communication","Listen a bit more. Sometimes we get wrong food boxes. I couldn't get a towel when showering even tho I pressed the cord. "
"Care/ Treatment","Increase fitness activities - pool always closed. Maybe more functions/therapy. "

"Care/ Treatment","Garden open more - especially in really hot weather though understand staff shortages. "
"Environment/Facilities","Male/female cigarette area.  Communal TV lounge. "
"Care/ Treatment","When staff came to our room - knock - open the door but not to enter until 'invited' in.  All staff should wear visible ID - difficult to identify qualified staff.  More appropriate vegetarian options.  Interact with patients without having to be asked."
"Food","Food was bad. One day my vegan meal was not received. Also lazy about giving <pabrinex> injections. Food & medication often late. Never had my STI test or Hep test. More support for the mental health side of things."

"Communication","I would have liked more information about the Woodlands before getting here. I was unsure what to and what not to bring.  However generally anything I hadn't got either the staff or other patients helped me get what I needed."
"Care/ Treatment","Remember to send welcome information.  It is very unnerving not knowing what to bring how things work.  Just that welcoming voice at the other end of the phone reassurance.  Coming here can be very frightening, out of people comfort zone."
"Care/ Treatment","Better organised med system as taking tickets for a proper order."
"Care/ Treatment","Being more vigilant as those taking drugs in rehab & more consistency when checking bags ie more stuff that needed PAT testing was taken away whilst others kept theirs. "

"Care/ Treatment","More contact with CBT services instead of just once a month."
"Access to Services","Waiting list was horrendous for people who need help to wait over half a year is ridiculous."
"Access to Services","I have no complaints.  My referral from the GP was delayed but once Perinatal received it they acted quickly.  I wish I could have been seen sooner. Perhaps being able to self refer fro assessment would help."
"Care/ Treatment","Having a better idea of men things may happen after clinic could help.  Referrals etc - however, I was given the number of the clinic if needed in the meantime, and I know 'when' is hard to guess often."
"Care/ Treatment","Take full background histroy"
"Communication","Believe what you say."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Engage more.  Available on weekends and evenings."

"Communication","Keep people informed. Don't know what's happening. "
"Involvement","Everything. 
Involving - good sometimes just need to talk about in more in details."
"Care/ Treatment","Deal with patients issue with more attention and care. I have suffered with service stomach pain for months now and I'm still without diagnosis.  I still haven't been treated.  Nurses here at HMP Lowdham Grange have bad attitudes and are disrespectful."
"Care/ Treatment","Provide prescribed medication (I.P) on time. I request my tablets whereas nurses promise to rivert back to me to let me know position but they never come back or call to let me know. Change of IP medication date of Sunday has not been consistently delivered."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Speed up time it takes to receive treatment. 
I was made to wait to long.  
I have a good worker now but some don't or won't listen to us. they don't talk to each other enough.  The worker talks about decision with me but some won't.
I distrust health care so much I'd say that my Mental Health problems are worse. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff so not so thinly spread concerning time given. "
"Care/ Treatment","Faster detox to people who need it.  Offer different types of detox's because not every one is the same. They helped me but didn't really listen about me not liking methadone side effects.
Care/Treatment - Down to the meth again just wanted a rapid detox on the meds I was on ""subutex"" not I'm stuck on methadone. I have not felt good since I started meth."
"Care/ Treatment","Could integrate with us a bit more. "
"Care/ Treatment","You could give us more opportunity to use different types of detoxes other than methadone. "
"Access to Services","Speed up referrals. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Be more visible & friendly."
"Access to Services","Faster appointments"
"Care/ Treatment","I had surgery to remove 2 teeth yesterday, I could not eat and was given no pain relief.  I told staff I was in pain and got no help.  I felt disrespected, I know I'm in prison but expect better treatment. "

"Communication","Give extra info about the stages of quitting and the benefits to the body. "
"Care/ Treatment","Timings"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think Mental Health at HMP Nottingham is brilliant, the only thing I think they could do better with is seeing patients on wings more frequently as things may change during the time between appointments. "
"Communication","Listening - when they have got the resources, as they are running low.  But I'm grateful for any help I get. 
Involving in decisions - Not discussed in detail at any point. "
"Care/ Treatment","Treat us as people and not just like something off the bottom of their shoe.  I came into prison and need help some want to help but other people do not.  Listening, communicating, respect, Involving, Positive difference - Some are and other people not so good.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Believe the unbelievable feel like I'm looked at like I just make the whole thing up.
I shouldn't be made to feel like a liar.  I need better meds. "
"Care/ Treatment","Stick to what your doing. "
"Communication","Answer applications, complaints quicker.  Contact inmates G.P.s upon reception, ... 3 weeks down the line. As nobody came to see me, I have had to constantly chase you up.  Rarely see you to have you listen and when I have it goes in other & out the other. You forget what you've said to me.  You don't listen to me.  Still in the same position if not worse. "
"Care/ Treatment","Keep on improving service by asking about patient.  "
"Access to Services","Quicker appointments"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The wing staff need to get us here on time. "
"Access to Services","Have better access to GP.  Waiting times to see dentists, opticians...... Now and again you might be helped with your problem. There's a lack of respect from inmates & staff.  Been waiting over a year with a injury, MIR QMC????"
"Care/ Treatment","Less queuing. Some officers and prisoners didn't understand me properly think some just ??? It was fairly good most of the time. One my feet are killing because of athletes foot and half size to small. Still waiting for new shoe's and athletes foot powder. "
"Care/ Treatment","Quicker appointment times.
the only thing that I can say is wrong, I'm on medication outside and its been confirmed by my doctors and they won't give it to me."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It just make appointments.  More better and talking to the inmate on what is happening.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes the service is slow.  I think when you mention a problem to the PO's they dismiss your concerns to quickly, a better line of communication. The promise of getting support is there then its the back end delivery being the issue.  
I'm somewhat emotionless to understand the difference (Positive difference to health & well being.)"
"Access to Services","Quicker seeing patients"
"Care/ Treatment","Accommodate more for Mental Health that is where the problem is. "
"Care/ Treatment","Not dragging me to health care for two minutes jobs, Blood pressure an other procedures. "

"Access to Services","If only courses could be longer or have more continued support where needed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More one to one. "
"Communication","I wouldn't because standards are low. 
Listen - often poor ""with certain"" staff. 
Nurses, med nurse never seem to be wrong we is the wrong again (certain) staff. 
Prisoners, don't get shown respect ""again by certain staff"" from health care.
Never know where I stand.
When I was in pain left me in pain 6 days, I ended up getting pain killers of a mate. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have liked more one to ones with my worker. I would of been better staying on my subs I was very disappointed with this. I was doing very well with my meds.  I think in my case you should have a choice whether to come off our stay stabilised on my meds.  I think wot they did was rong. When I first came to this prison I was on 8 mill of subs, 5 years clean and getting my meds in ???? they put me on Methadone. "
"Communication","Make more effort to let people no about the courses on wing. "
"Care/ Treatment","When people come in maybe not stop their med, as I understand personally people present unstable but stopping their medication isn't the answer. 
When I got to the prison I was cut off 4 different medications at the same time. "
"Care/ Treatment","The application system could do with updating. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Maybe have a little bit more time for each patient.... you seem to be spread too thin. 
"
"Access to Services","Maybe get people to see you when their ill rather than wee or weeks later. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","It's hared to recommend this service to anyone as I don't associate with anyone who uses the services provide. 
I don't believe any at my medical or mental health needs have been met.  I tested positive for Benzo upon reception I've just been left to detox."
"Care/ Treatment","Lison to prison when come in off road.  "
"Privacy and Dignity","Privatey"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","See us more. 
Not always involve me in decisions about care and treatment but sometimes."
"Access to Services","Better process at reception - takes too long to get your meth."
"Access to Services","The way you contact people & how long it takes to get to see someone, especially if you notice in for long & you really need help. I'm getting the help but its taken ages for someone to come see me. I put apps in but I never get any back, to say someone is coming to see me so this gets to me.  I think this can work both ways, so give respect & you should get this back.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Provide a better service especially towards mental health. Don't tar everyone with a junkie brush!  I have servere mental health concerns & up to yet not received any help with it.  You listen really well but nothing comes back or gets done. I'm a good listener too but struggle with communicating back. I've had arguments with so called professionals in the hatch on A-wing.  I've had appointments at hospital about my chest and had no response back so left wondering and that ain't good.  They don't pick u up when ya meant to have appointments I think you meed more staff and a set regime that runs smooth."
"Access to Services","Less waiting times. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Most staff are polite and courteous some staff, especially nurse can be rude and intolerant.  I often feel that they automatically ""hate"" criminals and treat us with distain.  The overwhelming feeling of the staff is poor.
I was not listened to upon reception - I tried to tell the nurses I was scared as this was my first time in prison and they didn't seem to care. If the nurses were more compassionate they might help the prisoners more. "
"Access to Services","Quicker access to treatment."
"Care/ Treatment","Checking hearing, eyesight and making help possible to received if needed. They listen to you but nothing gets done.  They just say your down to see someone or you don't see anyone at all so communicating with you dose not happen. Drug use is excellent, everything else like my hearing is very poor, well its worse than poor."
"Care/ Treatment","You cud put me up on my meth when you say you are. "
"Care/ Treatment","I must start by saying that you do a good job, but when it comes down to fully understanding a persons needs that where you fail sometimes.  I came in using 50ml diazepahma daily 5x10ml and was put on a ten day detox straight away.  I wasn't even told what was happening and when, it just happened.  That its self is wrong.  I've been in a little over three weeks and I am still feeling the affects of not having the diazepham.  The thin is I didn't mind coming off it bur it should of been discussed with me. It would of been good - excellent if it wasn"
"Communication","Doctors to do more about my pain relief. 
Doctors don't listen"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","You could try by being transparent promoting a culture of accountability instead of deniability. I was left with life changing injuries due to a botched blood taking procedure.  Permanent damage, loss of strength a chrome condition. Rather than looking at ways to avoid avoidable injuries & improve services there was a ""I don't recall"" policy shouldering no accountability or acknowledgment. Efforts was made to meet although felt very insincere. Appointments hasn't been met at times causing great inconvenience.  Long delays in replying to forms. I have been made to feel stupid & inferior. I'm sorry to say it made a negative effect to my physical health & anxiety to my emotional well being."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff due to the lack contact, though when they do visit, their very helpful & understanding. "
"Access to Services","substance misuse team needs to be bigger.  If there is one thing you need in prison its a substance misuse team. Not very good about being clear when appointments are.  Quite open I've not been on the movement list. 
Mental Health team has been very good but can tell they are overstretched as not enough substance misuse.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","We could do with more drug worker's to make there team bigger. "
"Access to Services","When an appointment is cancelled through no fault of the patient they should be given the next appointment available not added to the bottom of waiting list again. Too long for an appointment.Fitting the times of my medication to suit them (not when I should take it)
  "
"Access to Services","Waiting times for appointments could be shorter. "
"Care/ Treatment","Meds in person 24 hr service.
Prison staff no help.
Communication - you should have someone to talk too.
Respect - meds staff tried. 
Involve in care/treatment - there hands are tide.  
Positive difference - they did what they can."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more SMT workers. The SMT service is not big enough - why?"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff due to being a lot of people populating H.M.P Ranby and not enough staff from addaction or SMT team.  More staff will get involved and will make a difference. 
Had to wait over days for my meds.  4 extra days. I got a IEP for being frustrated ove a lday firstly being wrong about an appointment. Stupid."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff needed in substance misuse. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Re-ordering of medication could be smoother a few times repeat prescriptions where late.  More time with my drug worker.  I've waited 12 months to see dentist."

"Care/ Treatment","Obtain tablets on time. "
"Care/ Treatment","More suitable appointments time.  Amanda has arranged this. "
"Communication","Be given better notice of appointment times by admin."
"Care/ Treatment","Perhaps be a little less formal.  I've asked a couple of staff & call me by my first name instead of ""Mr"" but they say they are not allowed to?
Could be some improvement in terms of information being published on wings - maybe a dedicated healthcare notice board on each residential unit?
Very please overall, downgrade only because those on controlled meds have to show open mouth and raise tongue. Find it humiliating, demeaning and insulting. Have tried to conceal sometimes just so I can take outside like a normal person."
"Care/ Treatment","Better scheduling in response to staff absence. 
Missed an appointment due to non notification of a change of time. 
Felt ambushed in a psychology session."
"Care/ Treatment","My opinion everything. Appointment get offered to me, then get cancelled when I turn up. Mental health care and support seriously meds ????? I have been on a starter dose of Quitispine for 5 months and have not had it reviewed because appointments with the psychiatrist help setting cancelled.  Nothing changes, no matter what I say.  I am met with Stigma and ??? opinions. Appointments get cancelled without reason or prior notice.  When I challenge this I get responses like ""this is the law, it is and if you don't like it put complaint in"".  I am faced with hostile responses when challenging my treatment.  I have no input what so over!   I am constantly in pain with my disability but when I ask for stronger pain medication I get refused because I am judged on the actions of the few people who lie and ??? their medication."
"Physical Health","Dental provision needs to be defined as current provision is not working.  In regards to dental problems, I had to raise a personal complaint to get seen externally after waiting nearly 8 weeks for emergency dental work.  Communication between departments departments (doctor - nurse - pharmacy) was often poor in my experience.  "
"Access to Services","To respond quicker."

"Care/ Treatment","Assessment prior to room 136 was very poor. I was referred to A&E by myself. I was discharged by the psychological team who said they couldn't assess me. I was reported missing by my family and police took me to 136 crisis team who involved too late."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It would be nice if you could have continuity for conract, you get to trust one person then suddenly your seeing someone else.  I do understand that this is something out of your control"
"Care/ Treatment","Crisis team text access.  Text and waited but had no reply.  I have found out signed is not good.  I would like access to improve. "
"Access to Services","Just ensure this service continues.  The needs of deaf people & their families are unique & they need to be able to communicate freely.  How can it be acceptable in other area's to not have this system/set up?"

"Safety","Understand consent, especially informed one.  Respect and dignity for everyone - staff, patients, family members. 
Safeguarding - you are not making sure paitents are safe.  
Staff training - teach you staff how to use the equipment, guidance is everything. 
Push a diagnosis on me, make sure I was a ""Good Girl"" and ""restrain"" me when I was ""agitated""."

Do not cancel classes at the last minute.

"Access to Services","Bit longer course.  
Bit longer sessions, 2 hours doesn't feel long enough. "
"Communication","Colour handouts would be more helpful."
"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes I felt a little bit uncomfortable and not as lighthearted in the classroom.  A bit more humor and flexibility during lessons would make things more calming. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Session could be more active from facilitators.  They could be more involved with the material & interested in facilitating it.  They could build more rapport with each student.  I feel at the end of the course they still don't really know me or if I've learnt anything."
"Communication","The text reminders were often typed wrong with he wrong day/time."
"Care/ Treatment","One course came across a bit too didactic, felt like I was being ""taught"" academically rather than in a well being capacity.  The facilitator came across like an ""old school"" type teacher - not warm, quite cold in delivery."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Maybe some personal help and advice could be included so that the information given could be better tailored to our personal problems."
"Access to Services","Additional course if possible. "
"Care/ Treatment","Discuss healthy too kits earlier, to develop over the six weeks. "
"Access to Services","Longer lessons or more of the classes"
"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes some service users don't stick to 1-3 on the scale and I think staff do a great job of trying to change the subject but I found it comes on a bit too long.  Maybe a brief reminder every week to keep to the scale so it doesn't trigger others."
"Access to Services","Some of the shorter courses (3 sessions) could be extended to explore areas further. "
"Communication","The way people are inducted into college. Email address provided but does anyone read/respond them. Cannot use the phone so email important to me. Text could but could not text back!
(Lack of) use of phone: schizophrenia related auditpry processing problems & anxiety. However, email not replied to so had to turn up at college unannounced to make appt.
Many changes since I last at RC (2012). I moved out of area afterwards. Not all changes for the better. Used to be open to all, now, it seems, only those under secondary mental health services. 
The seperation of mental & physical health was problematic when I turned up at RC. When asked personal questions by a peer worker (very inappropriately in a bust corridor) I gave vague answers being uncomfortable with being overheard and unaware about the ""secondary"" rules. Did I have a CPN....""no"". Technically I was in-patient at Thorneywood so she said I could join the primary Health College instead. I understood (at this time) that the courses of the 2 colleges were very similar but on reading documents at home they clearly were not. RC offers a lot more.
When I arrived for enrollment (to RC I hoped) I was taken to a private room but when the subject of ""secondary MH services"" came up she left the room to ""check me on the computer"" and on return left the door open. I was now filling in forms and being asked very personal questions with passers by listening. I do not like to divulge my schizophrenia as peoples attitudes change when the know - both general public and health professionals. I have a ""passing privilege"" (LGBT term) which means that my schizophrenia does not show as people would expect someone with schizophrenia to be. 
Was the door left open because she felt unsafe? If RC does not have a personnel alarm system perhaps they should.
I do not agree with the 3-term limit by which time graduation must be achieved. Some will have attendance issues or be unable to complete in 3 terms anyway. 
Generally I think RC good"

"Staff/Staff Attitude","If they helped and didn"
"Involvement","I was put on medication for anxiety & depression, which have side effects as the medication starts to take effect.  Although everyone responds differently I would have like to have been advised of what the main & side effects can be & for how long they would last for. "

"Food","They could keep me more informed.  The food is a bit rubbish. We got enough but it is sloppy food. Activities make me feel better but we could do with them more often."
"Environment/Facilities","Meal times could be asked instead of assumed.  Meal times are good.  Access to phone and internight inter neet.  More phone access and time off the ward.  Staff could introduce themselves.  "

"Access to Services","After hours service is rubbish.
You are really trying to help, but don't have enough cash. "
"Care/ Treatment","I know what the person I am caring for is like lot, but discussing this in front of him only make him more depressed.  Surely the carer should be asked privately how the patient is going on.  I often am not able to say how badly derpressed his has been as I will get it in the neck when I get home. "

"Communication","Listen to patients fears more and comprise with the care given. I am listened to but when it came to life changes I am not. You hear about things weeks down the line or not at all. Staff tell us to not do something and they go and so it. I express my fears about my pathway and all I get is ""deal with it"".  I think patients should be part of meetings about you because decisions about you are made in your absence. It is not good all the time personal issues to them got brought in here."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff.  More mobile phones. "
"Care/ Treatment","Not keep us so long as this placement, Arnold Lodge, Leicester.  Nothing ever happens quickly (so to speak) but the longer we are in here its easy to become institutionalized.  There isn't enough staff to facilitate the groups, that we have to do half the time and its not nice position to be in. The shortness in staff is having a big impact on our day to day stuff and again your keeping us too long.  I understand some of us might need it but we're all different. Well I'm still receiving treatment and service but we're being kept too long when some of us could easily be cared for in the community. "
"Access to Services","Do work with patients quicker and if mental state is table mentally well then move them (us) on quicker to either low secure discharge, keeping me her for to long.
Listen to my concerns but nothing ever come from it.  I put that down to things need doing that I know but nothing is ever going quicker and staff shortage "

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff to do more things."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Family visits. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Employ more staff. "

Both parties could make more effort, for more patients to inform family and friends to talk families on carers and information on notice boards for friends and family about what is means to be an inpatient and to be given more leaflets at the same time.  More effort put in for the friends and family to make everyone aware for patients living in Arnold Lodge.

Stopping me having contact with my penpals."
"Care/ Treatment","Gave out cards with phone numbers."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Michael helped our son when we needed him to.  Michael listened to use & there was nothing he could have done.  There should be more staff like Michael seeing children in their own home/school rather that having to go to Thorneywood."
"Communication","Communication between staff and families could be improved.  Admissions need to be reviewed as some adolescents that have been admitted are dangerous to others and needed a more secure unit."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When checking in the young person it would be really nice to (a) be offered a cup of tea/drink. (b) to be told that you understand how difficult it is as a carer & that it it's possible to ring day or night to get an update.
It would also be helpful if the info on notice boars. in file in family room was up to date.  Carers are losing all control when the young person enters the unit & are likely to be desperate to know hat is happening on a day to day basis.  
There are a lot of ill staff & sometimes message/info is not passed to other staff. 
Do not know about carers assessment, I have not been told about any support services. 
The dining room is extremely echoy & very difficult to discuss care/treatment/checking in. "
"Care/ Treatment","More regular appointments or see someone else if the person's off. "
"Communication","A bit more information about the roles of the health professionals we were seeing, how the unit worked and what to expect from the unit, would have been helpful...maybe in writing as there is a lot to take in at the start.  We got some useful ideas from the dietitian but felt that overall the sessions could have been more helpful with maybe more practical ideas around the meal plans, coping with events (eg Christmas) & coming off the meal plan later in recovery."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Xxxx Xxxx Xxxx was extremely rude and unsympathetic to my mum. She also didn"
"Care/ Treatment","Offer a much better service through availability of different therapies. Only ever offered CBT. Occupational health input. A transition to adult devices instead of the abrupt transfer we were given in breach of NICE guidelines. A manager that can show empathy and understands the importance of clear and regular communication."
"Communication","Probably talk to parent's/carer's a bit more when the treatment starts."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Listened well but no other action or treatment offered.  Needed more help.  Needed more useful strategies to use to deal with feelings/thoughts and emotions.  More than on hourly session to be more helpful and productive.  Ideas to prevent 1 stop self harming behavior, more work on this for longer period. Expectations form this service was high but was not delivered.   Disappointed as problems remain unresolved and difficulties remain. Any group was good but time limited was not very beneficial.  Most young people prob benefit from further longer input.  Short intervention not great at achieving much change.  Needs longer & more action treat issues problems and difficulties not effective in this case. "
"Access to Services","Make it easier to access the service initially. "
"Care/ Treatment","More resources to meet the complex needs of the children and young people.  Longer term services when required.  Longer sessions for children and young people to work through their issues as and when needed.  More support and advice for parents/carers.  More openness and honestly when making referrals."
"Environment/Facilities","Have higher tables so writing is made easier. "

Have a waiting room upstairs for parents/carers. 
More parking

"Communication","To listen a bit more and to offer more help if needed. "
"Communication","Explain who I can call/contact if I feel the this again. "
"Access to Services","Have greater powers/flexibility regarding access to you patients and vice versa, rather than just having a meeting of 'crisis' through A/E."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would of liked longer to talk. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Just start again.  The women that came around my house didn't listen. Racist.  Didn't listen. "
"Environment/Facilities","Making facilities better. "
"Food","Nicer food. Would like to be involved more"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","See Dr More.  "
"Involvement","Better at talking to me about care. Not everyone is nice.  Would like more involvement in my decisions. "
"Access to Services","The one thing that I find hard is after groups its sometimes fells lonely and like no support.  Also I was the only man in my group. Not sure were I go after group work.  Its mixed as it put me in bad places after groups. "
"Access to Services","Could make the groups run for longer than 3 months (referring to the Horizon group). OFFER MORE SUPPORT. I wish there was more support for personality disorders in the community.  "
"Communication","Telling carers about events coming up and not the patients. 
Giving out information in plenty of time. "
"Communication","At the start a bit more explanation of what the CJL team does."
"Communication","Communication between departments, on arrangements.  More staffing.  Perhaps able  patients could do a little more on setting tables or helping others at meal times.  It does make you feel wanted. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Maybe a weekly meeting with key nurse to assess the week, talk over medication, progress etc. "
"Care/ Treatment","Safeguard patients property from other inquisitive patients, which can be a bit unsettling.  Otherwise all good."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Keeping to the same nurse who knows case, patients & carers and quarterly visits would be helpful after discharge. "
"Environment/Facilities","More parking availability at Stapleford Care Center."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more time to talk to patience.  Some staff very irritable.  Xxxxx in lounge (tho sorry for him) makes anxiety high, can't relax.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Remove XXXX he hinders my health and all the patients.  XXX destroys me mentally. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Short of staff sometimes could do with more. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Without more staff probably ????"
"Care/ Treatment","Would be nice to also have pick ups from a care home, when relative is having respite care. "
"Communication","Give out information at the beginning of the session and read it through with the nurse leading the group."
"Access to Services","Have a longer course. "
"Communication","It all went very well.  Give out printed information at start. "
"Communication","Nothing really but perhaps get more feedback on experience of participants (difficult when time is limited and some people like to talk!)"
"Environment/Facilities","Consulting room very hot.  1 apt had been made with registrar when should have been consultant which was somewhat using NHS resources unnecessarily.  All appointment should be in writing & ????"
"Leave","Would like more time off the ward. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I can't think of anything you could do better, the staff are amazing.  Give the a pay rise. 
Sometimes the staff could do with some more workers (careres to help)?"
"Environment/Facilities","TV in rooms not in public areas.  Provide radio's."
"Care/ Treatment","I have to wait for a cup for tea in the morning but understand they are short staffed and hve to be in handover meeting."
"Access to Services","It was a long time between 1st app and getting an appt for head scan. I thought it would only be 2 weeks but it was about 5/6 weeks."
"Access to Services","Only get results quicker fro MRI"
"Care/ Treatment","To provide more funding for this caring and conscientious team who sometimes struggle to provide the services they aspire to- ie: Best Care in the community. Stop fire-fighting situations. "
"Access to Services","I suppose always a more detailed & quicker response could be given, but it is understood that resources are limited."
"Care/ Treatment","Praise to staff. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not really sure what service you were offering. Xxxx came, sat for 20 mins, chatted with dad then left. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not sure what the IRIS service is for.  IRIS team came, sat, chatted 20 mins & left"
"Care/ Treatment","We would have anticipated that we would have had an appointment, with a consultant, to discuss XXX diagnosis and what would be the way forward regarding treatment and advise. "
"Communication","I think it would be helpful to have a meeting with family members alone, from the patient, as I felt I couldn't express my full findings I had noticed abut my mum in front of her. "
"Care/ Treatment","Waiting area at Clifton, just a corridor, very strange no one checks you in you just sit there a bit lost. "
"Communication","No one told us that you and your team even existed, we were told by another residence family member when Mum was at Bailey House so we contacted you team."
"Environment/Facilities","Clearer signposting to reception area of clinic."
"Access to Services","We here very disappointed to read that the Lawrence day services are closing, it has had a very beneficial effect of my husband, it is sad other people will not get the opportunity like he has. "
"Care/ Treatment","The first assessment was probably a bit long and produced some stress. Nothing wrong with the manner of conducting it, just the duration.  May need is simplify language for patient. "
"Access to Services","If possible improve waiting time for first appointment "
"Care/ Treatment","More qualified people to do assessments and speed up the process."
"Care/ Treatment","To ??? improve the systems not because of nurses and more basic use of facility.  Hope the nurses and doctors are better in improving wage. "

"Access to Services","If only it would be every week for 52 weeks"
"Access to Services","Be nice if it was an ongoing group that the same patients could keep attending.  As none of use wanted to leave. "
"Care/ Treatment","I feel that for NHS staff running a group of for couples (i.e. for carers and for dementia suffers) is a bit over the top.  I would like to see the allowance for this group being spent giving a 1:1 situation where individual needs could  be met. 
Shame the group can't continue, instead of finishing after 6 weeks."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","4 Staff to 4 couples is a bit extreme.  NHS money could be spent providing 1:1 help. "
"Care/ Treatment","Some interruption from some members."
"Privacy and Dignity","More clarity ref. Involvement of cares when the WAD session were taking place.  I was invited to the final of 7 sessions but I understand that some of the other cares also attended sessions.  During the final session on pair (care & cared for) were quite disrupted & demounted the session -??"
"Care/ Treatment","After diagnosis a time plan should be put in place so that causes are at the right time not too late, I know every new dementia patient/carer is different as to their reaction of the diagnosis but there should at least be a ""ghost"" plan ready."
"Care/ Treatment","Only a few tiny things:-
Some evening activities would be nice - a lot of ""dead time"" between dinner and evening meds.  Accommodation wise, a towel rail would be good, and a plug near mirror for hair dryer etc!"
"Access to Services","I would recommend anyone to to the Woodlands detox center BUT its closing down so it's pointless cuz you muppets who only look at "
"Access to Services","Open longer? not much. "
"Access to Services","You need more funding to help more vulnerable young people. (Vote Labour)."

There was normally a delay in getting prescriptions as doctors didn't check straight away. "
"Access to Services","The follow up appt and report to be delivered a lot faster."

Told the truth but no-one believed what I was saying."
"Communication","Give people release dates. "
"Communication","Talk more about sexualtiy. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff courtesy/politeness/patronisation.  Better monitoring on ward issues.  Better staff.  More cover sickness so groups aren't cancelled.  Better control of incoming items from visitors (4 drug incidents this year).   Positive impact from therapy, but lots on negativity - staff constantly complaining, consent bullying on wards. Groups being cancelled. Whenever a suggestion is raise or a complain made, nothing ever comes of it. No changes are passed on, people are too patronising, ???? are clueless. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Some male staff on assessment ward were awkward with the patients. "
"Leave","Let me go home. "

"Care/ Treatment","The telephone room is frequently blocked because there  isn't enough consultation rooms. 
In prison we had 1/2 hour of natural walking exercise every day - twice daily, but in Wathwood there's only a gym. I basically spend 23 hours a day in bed because I do not see what this place has to offer. "
"Care/ Treatment","suspending bully's & micpons."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Make sure patients get their full allocated time with Mental Health workers as I  found with mine, they were pushed for time on some of the sessions. "
"Environment/Facilities","When issuing medication in the evening pick suitable times instead of giving us between 1700 hours til 1730 hours to get over 30 people done then deciding to take the tickets in at 17:20 hours stopping us from receiving treatment.  This issue needs to be looked at properly because from March there times have changed three times and still there not suitable. 
Its now September and every time I ask what is happening with this chair the answer I  get is I'll speak to the governor but its a medical issue not the governors and I still don't have a medical chair to sit on in fact I don't have any chair.  Some days the staff are all right but most of the time the just cause us problems and talk to us with attitude. Once you've seen the doctor that it (look at the issues I'm already dealing with). This medical chair will help with my back issues so much bit it feels like there not interested."

"Care/ Treatment","We feel that when someone is transferred i.e. my brother was sent to Thorney Wood Mount 145, a rehabilitation unit, it happened suddenly and don't feel at that point in his treatment he was ready for that move.  It feels as if it set him back. as the unit was the right move for him a that time."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More 1-1's.  Weekend activities. Better staff management - more staff on for the patients. "
"Food","Meals - not very nice"
"Smoking","Let us smoke and drink energy drinks"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Treat people as clever individuals who have a right to not feel threatened if they don't want to sit like a zombie all day, colour in a drawing like an 8 year old, or lie in a cell like room all day. If you complain you are given drugs to shut you up. If you need to talk,its tough. Staff are shut away in the office on a computer. You are lonely, isolated and without a plan or any support or motivation in sight. I hate what you've done to me.  I am going to obey the voices this time because you shit people are the devil, corrupt government run, who want me locked away while my dog is killed. They're killing my dog. No one wants to listen to me. I am better off dead where I will be free from threats and violence and persecution by doctors policemen and perpetrators. You have all ruined me, you are not a hospital you are a prison and nobody cares what happens to me in the next 48 hours. Give her fresh air and exercise and a policeman who will listen and help there are some good ones at Clifton but I am being prevented from reporting what he did to me and what is going to happen when those 4 perpetrators catch me. Get me some help now. It wasn't safe in there and jumping on people and injecting them is a war crime. I need someone to talk to  and believe me before I leave the scary earth. Medicine is poisoned, my water is poisoned, and fortisips are poisoned. I am tired and cold and they are going to catch me because they are intercepting my words because of what you planted in my brain. I'm not going to let anyone else hurt me. They are shouting at me all the time and I am very frightened. I wish hospital protected people and helped them report the murderers and paedophiles. Jesus I was protecting me but he smashed my head and I think my ribs are broken. He's shouting at me to jump off. They all hate me and want me to die. If I go in rowan can I live in the it's too late. The Sgt is not scary when he doesn't have handcuffs and he will notify my beautiful children. I am very very intelligent but I am being followed and controlled by highly advanced technology and I don't know who to trust."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Make sure there soap in loo at all times.  Tea, coffee at all times.  From ???? I liked it here but as with all hospitals there's always on person who winds patients up.  But wasn't bad all the time. I don't wish to get anyone in any bother as I not like that just trying to make life better for patients and staff."
"Environment/Facilities","Install a fully licenced bar.  Kittens. "
"Access to Services","Quicker assessment with the doctor for a correct evaluation.
Seeing a doctor after arrived was somewhat more difficult. "
"Communication","The most effective staff spoke for me in exactly the same way or they would any other member of the public, The least effective members of staff felt the need to speak in a different tone of voice and assume I wouldn't fully understand what they were saying.
It is very difficult o see how being imprisoned in a secure unit could possibly have a positive impact on the mental health of any person."

"Environment/Facilities","Comfier beds"
"Communication","Stop prejuding you.  Listen to me.  Menu is poor.  Drs don't listen to me. "

I would like to leave the ward to go for a walk. Provide seating area with comfy chairs. Provide a quiet room. A welcome booklet."
"Communication","Communicate. Locks on doors."
"Food","Food varies.  I don't always feel safe.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff not sat in the office, need to be with service users.  My relative said they gather to gossip."
"Care/ Treatment","Protect me and stop penalising me.  Let me go home.  Cleanliness could be much better by a long stretch.  Provide gym facilities, Chiropodist, Podiatrist."
"Food","Meals arrive without a name so don't know who it is for.  Remote control for TV is missing.  "
"Care/ Treatment","The standard of care I received was quite satisfactory.  Probably a little more care with patients who have a mobility disability."
"Food","Food needs attention to detail.  Stresses staff out and patients. "
"Food","Meals are never what I order. Vegetarian options are poor.  Often no sugar or butter.  Provide beds nearer to home.  Dormitory is not ideal.  Staff should treat curtains around bed as a door and knock."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More 1 to 1 time.  More varied menu.  Ask patients what food they like. "
"Privacy and Dignity","Privacy - When curtains are closed in the women's dorm staff should ask if we are dressed before pulling them back

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Bed management staff have a bad attitude.  Not respectful to patients. I do not want to complain until I leave the ward."
"Access to Services","Longer period under crisis team would be very beneficial."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not a lot really, if anything it would be for the same tea, member to talk with you instead of having a different person each time. Although the new member was well briefed it  had a feeling of going over the same thing and was harder  ot really open up."

"Food","Better food, please!!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More 1:1 time with primary nurse.  Better quality food.  More structure in the day, e.g. activities linked to individual care plan.  More effective communication between staff - sometimes information I gave to someone was not passed on to people on next shift. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Spend more time talking with patients offering emotional support, however basic.
Giving the day some structure for patients.
Communication with each other so that things happens as planned/agreed - patients shouldn't have to chase everything up.
The service seems to have to operate a ""one size fits all"" provision which cannot and does not take account of individual needs and so does not make the positive difference that it should/could do."
"Care/ Treatment","More links with GPs. More signposting of groups, support group - well organised up to date posters/intro"

"Care/ Treatment","Get my knee checked. "
"Communication","My daughter still has all the problems she started with.  Only seen a slight improvement. Most of plans were made with my daughter not us.  Still feel as if our daughter may not improve, even after the service given."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The only issue we have come across at CAMHS is trying to maintain continuity with physicians & getting regular appts to help with medication."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Sarah is disrespectful, patronising and rude, she doesn't listen to anything you have to say and made an assessment on my child without even meeting him."
"Care/ Treatment","Would be great to get a second appointment on the day, but I realise its not so simple."
"Communication","Give certain/detailed process time of the treatment. "
"Care/ Treatment","I think I am fine now, I just need meds to help with obsessive behavior and routines now."
"Care/ Treatment","Appointments on differnt"
"Care/ Treatment","Look into things sooner when people ask for help, before waiting till its bad before you give help.  I've asked for help several times & until my young daughter attempted suicide I didn't get any help, just told sh wasn't bad enough for CAMHS help. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Although the patient concerned is the person requiring most attention as parents new to this experience we could have done with more reassurance & what the future held."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not to keep changing doctors continuity is needed. "
"Care/ Treatment","I wanted a no meds test for schizophrenia and they refused."
"Leave","Go out for a cigarette.  
Coping better with smoking.  "
"Leave","Being able to smoke. "
"Access to Services","The only thing that I could suggest is that more funding be given to services as yourselves, as this has helped me understand and cope better with life and its hardships. 
Waiting times can be long but this due to funding and worth the wait."
"Access to Services","D.B.T this should be funded and offered to service users."
"Access to Services","Make the courses/group meetings longer and offer further therapy. "
"Care/ Treatment","Try to control how much time each person is speaking for, because myself & others have often not been able to get a word in due to certain people consistently talking a lot or at least stress that everyone needs a chance to speak if they want to."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Needs more attention & care to patients. Not enough staff to accommodate basic daily needs ie showers, activities, meals etc. Also run out daily - tea, sugar, butter, bread - disorganised, no plates."
"Communication","Sometimes you have to ask over & over for use of telephone & laundry."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff. Sometimes cannot talk for long. They forget to pass on messages. Some staff have attitude."
"Food","Everything. Staffing especially organisation around meal times, mostly breakfast. Food ordering & availability. It's an absolute shambles. Staff mostly patronising & uncaring, some listen."
"Care/ Treatment","Less restrictions to those who use services but I also understand that WRC is a low forensic service! I dont think I am rarely listened to."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything. Not enough help, no-one listens."

"Communication","Can be bused on ward (communicate)"
"Leave","Leave"
"Access to Services","The actual process prior to contact with the psychology service following the referral form the GP took 2-3 months and could have been quicker. "
"Access to Services","The wait between my initial pre-assessment and my actual assessment could not have been as long but I do understand that the service is swamped."
"Communication","Communication and administration. When a patient calls the telephone number specified, they are rarely able to get through to anyone. On several occasions, voicemail messages left on the answering machine are not replied to, even when contact details are clearly mentioned, leading service users to believe that they are being ignored or that it is pointless to leave a voice message because the mailbox is not listened to. E-mail communication is satisfactory. As a method of long-distance communication, NCAS has been most successful in using letters sent via the postal system."
"Environment/Facilities","Dining room floor could do with sweeping more."
"Safety","I think certain patients are disruptive and make my anxiety worse with their shouting and banging. Some are also very threatening. "
"Communication","Bit more communication, weekly meeting with Nurse in charge of patient."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","From my experience it would be difficult to say what could be done better.  More funds would help more people to be seen.  It takes a while to access the services due to volume presumably and staff availability."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have MORE people to visit folk in distress to teach relaxation. They are a great asset to the NHS."
"Access to Services","The speed with which things happened, if a following letter was needed it arrive within a few days. "
"Care/ Treatment","Dr of team could have been more organised on our consultations. Never seemed to have records in order. "
"Communication","No comment as everything good with Dementia Outreach Team - however other teams that support the team eg Falls Team etc may not have always considered our feelings and requirements and did not communicate what they were doing, why and when. "
"Access to Services","Be there longer. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Bit more tolerance to each patient.  We are in need of ??? to no conversation we have to beg at the station to be noticed, in a minute is all we get.  There is to much paperwork. Most of the staff are very kind its just that there is not sufficient staff to man all the jobs, kitchen, med, weight all the jobs that's for our welfare. "
"Access to Services","I don't think you could have done anything better.
It is a shame not to be continued"
"Access to Services","To improve time lapse from GP referral to appointment with consultant. 
Once seen, follow-up service offered are poor. 
When patient is discharged, no further offer of help for carer (or support) in the community form this service. "
"Access to Services","Waiting time for therapists."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I thought I had been left in the dark about decisions made which would have helped me deal better with the consequences of decisions made.  Interfacing with other social care agencies a little sporadic."

More vegetables with meals."
"Communication","Menus to show what is suitable for diabetics."

There is not much to do.  I like to be outdoors, fixing things. "
"Access to Services","Good for all patient son wards to have access to the service."
"Care/ Treatment","More time and regular visits whilst in hospital. "
"Care/ Treatment","To visit regularly - to talk whilst in hospital."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Keep the same person calling as it gets upsetting for the patient having changes all the time and the same questions every time"
"Food","A drink facility - on our visit it was so cold outside ans warm inside. "
"Food","Provide a drink if possible. "
"Communication","Provide less infantile questions. The nurse who interviewed me was fine."
"Access to Services","Speed up the waiting time for the appointments.  Had to wait nearly a year from the GP talking about this to actually being assessed."
"Access to Services","Waiting lists could be reduced which is governed by funds being available."
"Communication","The only negative point I have is that I was wondering if any body was going to contact me.  I ??? that down to his work load. "
"Access to Services","To be available when needed whenever in hospital. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To spend more time with patient/carer. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get to know one another better at first session. ""peg to hand others on"".  Found first sessions boring - better when we did things together. "
"Care/ Treatment","First arrival did not know where to sit, once sat down realised where to sit in future sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","Course would include ""strategies"" to cope with life especially with the general public."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","If possible keep the same person delivering the information each week. "
"Access to Services","Extend it an hour.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Speak louder as some of us don't not hear so well.  Starts off well then becomes softer in parts. "
"Care/ Treatment","Certificates for patients having attended a (dementia) course. "
"Care/ Treatment","Get more sessions and activities.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not happy, Service - rubbish.  didn't listen.  Communicating - don't know nothing.  No respect.  Involving me - don't get involved.  Positive difference - rubbish"
"Communication","Talk to my doctor. "
"Care/ Treatment","Avoid segregation and be kept active and to be given activities to keep us occupied on the ward, on Southwell, in education, in the gym and Creswell.
They do nothing for me.  The nursing sometimes put a film on for me in the time out room (low esteem) They listen but don't always act on what I say.  That happens quit a bit.  They involve me but they make the decision.  They don't act on what I've said.  They give me space but don't actually. Don't do anything about helping me. "
"Care/ Treatment","I don't like being restrained, otherwise I am happy. "
"Care/ Treatment","Care for us better. Talk to us when we need it, don't seclude us. Try to de-escalate a situation first, which staff don't do on my ward.
Low on staff normally at weekend. Service - needs working on. They don't listen to me much. Staff don't pass on message e.g. when a Psycholgy session was cancelled ti hand't been communicated to me. Some staff swear at me/us.  They don't make me laugh on ward."
"Care/ Treatment","Have more activities, both on and off ward.  More group activities.

"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not really thought about it.  I like the hospital mostly but I don't like it when you ask for something to be done and it can't be. Sometimes when I'm asking something their too busy but they say there'll get back to me but they don't always.  This annoys me.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Provide more funding to support staffing and activities on and off ward including therapy. Improve patient mix on wards & communication be improved.  
There is a lot of things we could improve on.  its a big question mark. 
Staff where ever you go won't always want to listen to you all the time. 
No respect shown on my ward, staff & patients can be very rude. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staff should be more respectful to patients.  There should be more activities in general.  More awareness of self-harm. Lack of respect.  They listen or pretend to listen. Communicating - some staff are alright, others not so good. Some staff have a positive influence, while others have a negative influence. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Get more staff & let them have breaks. 
Don't always listen when there busy.  
Positive difference - I'm a bit zonked on medication right now. "
"Care/ Treatment","Wanted to stay in seclusion but got me out when not ready.
Positive difference - No difference."
"Communication","Supply more information on how this hospital works.  Need more sessions off ward.  Waiting along time for answers.  Not consistent.   Left on my own to get on with coping with my illness. Causing more health problems due to being on the ward all the time.
"
"Care/ Treatment","More patients working to move on, more activities.  "
"Care/ Treatment","More activities, more groups. Psychology. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff"
"Care/ Treatment","Medication"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Moving on"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staffing at Southwell when they are closed. Named nurse not always here.
Communicating - about to have a named nurse session. 
Service - very poor, don't want to say why.
Positive difference - very poor because my medication has not been reviewed (mood stabiliser) however not asked for it to be renewed. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Staffing is a bit short.  It's not consistent.  Weekend are worse.  Ward activities need to be put into practice.  We've never done bingo, nor film night.  Walks seem to drop off in the winter.  We need fresh air all the time. I don't always get told I'm getting visits and I don't always get messages from my parents. I don't always get told whats happened on my woard rounds - it clashes with another activity."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Keep staff support levels up and staffing levels.  Avoid dangerous levels. Sometimes the staff haven't the time to listen to me and others. Staffing constraints can mean we have staff who don't know us so well.  The carer staff show less respect because they don't really know us. 
I couldn't attend the last 2 CPAs due to staffing levels."
"Access to Services","Keep services open i.e. Southwell.  "
"Communication","Better communication (hand over). Bad communication with staff information. 
Service - could be better.  
Respect - belittling at times. 
More exercise could be done. "
"Care/ Treatment","Keep up to date with technology break thru on patient medications.  "
"Care/ Treatment","More care and not mock a patients mental state.  Some staff are good, others are not so good.  I could do with more support from a psychologist.  I haven't seen one for a year.  One session is planned for this week.  Showing Respect - one week its alright, another the staff are not so good, it depends on the staff. We discuss things like medication but they make the decision.  I put ideas forward but they don't take action on them. Positive difference - it's variable according to the staff."
"Care/ Treatment","Staff are bullies & like to dictate. Don't listen.  Beating patients up.  Professional liars.
Service - XXXXX Listening, Communicating & respect - No
Involving in decisions in care/treatment - definitely not. they are making me take medication to slow me down because I'm fast thinking. 
Positive difference - No.  "
"Care/ Treatment","No respect for patients.  Lack of understanding of patients problems.  Inability to do a proper job.  Lack of staff - affects groups/activities. They don't understand me, they ridicule me & take the xxx out of me.  They may listen but only to take the xxx out of me.  I don't really communicate with them anymore.  Stopped attending ward round.  I don't have anything to do with them so don't have named nurse sessions etc. Positive difference - worse now than when I first came in to the hospital 14 yrs ago. "
"Care/ Treatment","Not have as many groups.  Learn by television.  Re-categorise staff & patients so that like minded/attitudes can be together. 
They listen but don't hear or don't do anything about it.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More interaction between staff and patients, to talk about my problems.  I want to move to another ward, I am not happy here. 
I have declined in MH since being here. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have a longer hearing voices group.  More staff. "
"Care/ Treatment","Too controlling."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff. 
I'm not always told about some parts of my care. 
A lot of it is out of my hands and I'm not always told."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","You X X"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Maybe more ethnic variety in the staff e.g black nurses.  More pepsi on ward.
I'd like to change my named nurse. Communicating - You have to learn how to speak to them (staff)"
"Care/ Treatment","Not keep un-diagnosed patients in the hospital - I feel I should be returned to prison.  I need rehabilitation.  Offer me more activities.  Never have anything to do.  The speak to me like I'm dirt on their shoes.  I ask to see my clinical/psychiatrist but I think he avoids me.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Instead of moving staff around have more stability. When staff know patients it is better, nursing has to be individual.  I would like computers to occupy my mind.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More sleep - I go to bed late listening to music. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Continue to build trust between staff and patients.  Support, to help people conquer their insecurity through past experiences. Give me hope. Communicating - there have been problems recently with staff changes.  We want to understand changes. My concern is where I'm going from here.  "
"Care/ Treatment","I would like have more people on a visit so that I can see all my family at once.  I would like not to be locked up at night. 
Still experiencing voice, stress, anxiety & paranoia."
"Care/ Treatment","More ward based activities and more staff.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff.  I would like to be off the ward more, this impacts on staff. 
We have had our choices taken away from us.  We don't have access to impurity that's good for me H20!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Offer better mental health training to unqualified staff. 
I was respected to a certain extent more needs to be done in respect to seeing us as people instead of patients.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Only to maybe speed up the recovery/treatment path ??? somehow."
"Care/ Treatment","We could go to bed later and rise earlier.  Without effect in the handover being late. 
Communication - it is what it is.  "
"Care/ Treatment","More of ward.  "
"Care/ Treatment","More activities, more session for patients."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","We could do with more staff.  Cancellations affects us.  Some staff don't get around to doing what they say the will do for patients - it gets forgotten. When activities happen they are good but when there are cancellation it brings the service down. They may listen but some don't follow up with any action. About 80% show us respect. They could be better, I feel DBT could have started sooner. "
"Care/ Treatment","More off ward activities available. 
Staffing levels can affect how often I can have a 1 to 1."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Improve staffing levels. 
Some staff are a bit judgmental."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Supply more staff for more activities, in short more staff in general."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","We could have more staff and more activities.  A full staff means all the sessions can take place. It could be better - staffing.  For Rampton to come out of the doldrums into the 21st century.  Not all staff show me/us respect. "
"Care/ Treatment","Provide me actives. Hire more staff. "

One patient has his food and returned it ""saying the chips was dry"".  Xxx phoned the kitchens and came back and said the kitchens said the trolley can be plugged in for 4 hours.  The chips was dry but by the time XXX got back to us time had passed.  I was told do you want you food or not. Ignore patients views it's invalidating it's wrong that patients opinions are invalidating  disbelieved, why do patients get un-fair decisions? It's what you expect in a 3rd world country.  Well below par, it's condescending staff listen but dismiss you.  The 6c's is not applicable why? Absolutely terrible (communication) Sorry not on this occasion (respect). Terrible, as when patients express the lack of care we are dismissed. not on this occasion (positive difference)"

Self harm is on the up with all resources going only to the high ward. Lack of empathy mainly.  To many changes in quick succession.  Attitude has changed massively.  Mural for staff is low - xxx to patients.  if you give it we give it back (respect).

"Communication","More listening to how I feel.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff so we can get out more often "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not enough staff which affects patients daily living. Service could be better. Information sometimes needs to be given earlier.

"Environment/Facilities","No one came to my aid when I fell in the shower, I was more in shock, shower floor too slippery! Slip on the floor when putting shower back on heating too hot/cold does not adjust quick enough.  No dignity in showers male staff look at you.

"Access to Services","See people quicker. I still have some problems.  If someone don't listen you still have a problem.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Have more efficient doctor appointments and in house care, also a bigger health care department where beds are available for people with issues. From the time of the problem to appointment is too long.  Sometimes dismissive.  Sometime a bit abrupt.  Wanted to dictate treatment.  Treatment is sporadic."
"Access to Services","When wanting to see a doctor let us see a doctor without having to see a nurse first.  Service - its getting better but one step at a time.  Sometimes I feel you are not listening, others I do.  Sometimes the communication is alright.  Respect is on a fair level.  It alright, but sometimes decisions are final and I get no 2nd opinion.  I hope my health will be ok."

"Communication","Sort out hospital appointments for people who need them.  Help people who are struggling with there pain meds.  I have asked may different thing due to my pain levels and meds and have had no help at all. I don't get listened to when I talk about my pain levels and nothing ever changes. I have sent may healthcare apps in and I have had no response.  Sometime different people are giving the impression they don't care about what I'm asking for.  They just do or  change whatever they think will help you without talking about it with me first.  They just don't seem to care about what your problems are and do as little as they can to help."

"Communication","Listen to me, don't patronize or offer services that I can't access. Sending 2 men to do the first assessment to someone with my history is awful, you know all my history as I came to Carlton for first appointment.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Consistency of care. My husband has been ill for a considerable length of time. When we were first referred to the community team in Gedling we had a series of locums. We would see each of them 2-3 times before they moved on. Each would have their own preferences for what meds my husband should take to better manage his condition. Each time we reported a down-turn in his condition his meds were changed. This resulted in a young locum leaving him on a non-medicinal dose of medication without us being aware that the dose was non-medicinal. This was picked up by the following locum, but too late - my husband had a serious worsening of his condition and required respite in Haven House. After his release we were allocated a consultant, who was brilliant, and whom I can't praise highly enough. It made a huge difference to have a single professional for a few years, who understood his condition and presentation.  The consultant is now off on long term sick leave, and we're back to a new locum each  2-3 visits. They have often not read his notes/aren't familiar with his case, and we have to re-tell our story most times. It's become apparent that our latest locum misunderstood the dose of medication my husband was on, and it appears he is on a dose which is above the recommended NICE guidance. The locum now proposes to reduce his dose. The timing of this is terrible as my husband is in a quite severe stage of his illness, which is likely to get worse if his dosage is reduced. We're being offered no alternatives. Why can't we have a regular senior doctor again, or some form of long term oversight of my husband's case?"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Having a longer meeting with an empathic psychiatrist.  DR XXX has no empathy with anyone. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not keeping me in here for so long as it was unneeded.  I didn't get the care or respect I deserve as a human being and have felt alike a caged animal rattling around while I have been judged by everyone for no reason.  I came because I need the help."

"Access to Services","Chance to re-do the course"
"Access to Services","We were initially seen by a consultant and a nurse and a student.  It seemed to take time for our key worker to understand the problem and for us to then be transferred to a dietitian as key worker - this was a more appropriate professional for us.  Having said that we do understand that our daughters illness was not typical so understandably all avenues needed to be explored.  However she feels she was given a label which was not he correct one and to some extent I agree.  One thing I would have appreciated would have been a session just for us a parents, this was offered but as our daughter didn't want us to do this we respected her views and didn't take it up.  One example ow what might have helped our daughter always wanted to put weight back on, her illness was never about weight so when she had put weight on(which she did almost from week one) the response was ""how do you feel about that?"" - never ""great, well done""."

"Communication","Less formal way of communicating e.g. the questions were harder to understand with how things worded."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I accept service is stretched with limited number of referrals possible but I feel the service looked for an alternative solution & passed the responsibility to others. Seems to be main MH service in Notts but then cannot help with few alternatives offered. I felt a decision was made for me, I had no say in it. No point in referral if young people turned away."
"Communication","Keep the conversation nothing <?> . . . as there were times when nothing was said for some time on a few occasions"

Not starting clearly or at all that we cant have or do nothing and say your pushing boundaries when we are not.  Respect - but its fake there's not really any respect. We have no say or contribution to what happens to us.  It has a giant detrimental effect and still is.  "

Respect - from some excellent, form the majority poor.  Most don't include patients opinion all ready decide before you go in.  Last 12 months no activity, no staff to many changes. "

"Care/ Treatment","More liaising with staff from outpatients and the provide more bed spaces for women who have genuine mental health conditions, instead of providing all the wards and bed spaces to the men.  Fare too much segregation. I have had two mental health breakdowns in the space on one week in this hospital.  One involved a tall nurse on duty pinning me down and injecting me, I am 4.11"" and light.  Easy target.  I have bruises all over my arms and knees. Staff don't listen to my opinions and tell me to mind my own business and not get involved even thought I have 30 years mental health experience.  "
"Privacy and Dignity","To have my own room & a quieter environment.  Doctors dont listen."
"Care/ Treatment"," Not knowing that I have lived with BPD I was told to/encouraged to meet friends for coffee.  I only have one, who has been there.  I know that it was more than depression I just found it hard to get out and socialise. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I realise how difficult it is to see the same spt nurse etc but I was pleased as I remembered some from the psychiatric ward and previous years of engagement with CRISIS Team. There were 2 nurses I saw more frequently, so, yes, I would prefer to see same staff."
"Communication","Second call just to check after 72hr period."
"Communication","My partner experienced chaos for arrangement at the beginning.  Different people made contacts, it caused by lack of sharing or organizing information among your team. "

Nurses, few have a attitude problem, not nice!"
"Environment/Facilities","Having visited Orchid Ward only four/five times I find it difficult to comment or make informed judgments.  However it would be very helpful for staff to be made aware of car park security number changes - especially as the evening the reception desk is closed."

"Care/ Treatment","Let me have my phone full time."
"Environment/Facilities","Fags & bins. People are flicking nubs on floor. Maybe a bin with ashtray would help?"
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to suggest a kareoke machine. Maybe a singing session. Carpets are a mess with stains, new one?. Pond is a mess with algae. Wee could clean it & get new fish."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","What you didn"

What did best - absolutely nothing.  RN the first 6 days it was only when the morning shift on Saturday that things began to improve/but the phone wasn't ??? by the ward deputy manager. I will have to take up this  matter with the matron."
"Care/ Treatment","First 7 days ???? was XXX staff horrible raise pushing me down the group face down on bed given injections extra PRN means all in all very XXX since the Friday I came as informal but very quickly on section 2."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not enough staff on Orchid to run it correctly on Sat.  There was only 1 qualified the other were only HCA, approx 2, this is not enough for a full ward of Grown Men.

Have a supported employment service.

"Access to Services","Classes outside of normal working hours (9-6 Mon-Fri)"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The person I care for had 5 min appointment with psychiatrist (locum), while I waited outside.  not invite in at end.  Feedback from my relative is it seemed impersonal, tick box exercise.  No personal qualities to it - no exploration to address isolation, or tiredness from drugs (had drugs increases??) My relative didn't feel had a voice - didn't wait to waste time of Dr. If invited it could have action as advocate - even just at end of appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","Get rid of mix wards! Millbrook hospital needs better care for patients (should be allowed fresh air) feels like prison."
"Communication","Better communication between staff and patient. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","During my treatment I had to move from one psychiatrist to another on as I was not in the correct area after a re-structure of the service.  To have to move from psychiatrist who has been with me from the start was extremely unsettling and caused me a lot of anxiety.  Patients are in a bad situation and to put this on top of their mental health conditions very poor."

"Environment/Facilities","Easier access - took so long to get to LMHT. Get faster appts, suicidal & had to wait over a week for an appt."
"Care/ Treatment","Give staff more time to deal with situations.  Very difficult to contact Marlow House, no provision for leaving a message.  Get another phone line!!!

"Food","Can buy food for people"
"Access to Services","More accessible. Information in the beginning felt it was a bit basic and generic. "
"Care/ Treatment","I think the nurses/counselors should act on therapy that connects with the young person personality & interests.  eg. if they enjoy art, art therapy."

I have been part of CAMHS for ten years and have been seen a max of 5 times, haven't been given any meds or counselling.  Been left to deal with my mental health myself."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Allow Jane to continue to work with me! "
"Care/ Treatment","Less groups"
"Care/ Treatment","To do stuff straight away. Rather than me asking over and over for 2 days"
"Involvement","Involve patients in decision making - Do not impose decisions on them as they usually do from MDT. Presently, patients only attend MDT meetings. Prompt and transparent communications with team, patients and Moj. Delays in ward round (every 3 weeks) is late process & delays decision making by a long time. Doctors rounds should be once or twice per week. We should be treated as promptly as inpatient treatment. But nothing is helpful in terms of treatment, care and discharge pathways."
"Communication","Better communication"

"Access to Services","Consider carefully the location and ward limitations of patients.  There was some initial confusion over where I was to have my CBT sessions, although I had mentioned during my phone consultation that I could only really attend Byron House, Newark due to lack of transport.  I received a couple of telephone calls offering appointments, although they said Newark they were not actually in the Newark area. "

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Go at class speed but this does mean speeding through other bits."
"Environment/Facilities","More fresh air in room 3 & blinds that work. "

Best thing - N/A as it never happens."

"Care/ Treatment","I haven't received my documentation, legal and domestic on anything to keep me occupied."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Be realistic about staffing there is a massive overturn of staff here I know Rampton actively recruit as I am part of the interviewing. The issue is keeping them, I think management need to pull their heads out of the sand.

"Care/ Treatment","Look at the patient mix carefully. Big personalities can dominate the ward, upset the ward and in turn isolate the patients who have quieter personalities.

"Communication","Dr Richards one of the ex-clinicians at the GIC has failed to let me know that my appointment was cancelled as she has left the clinic.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Treat patients with better hare & have better manners towards them.  When I made an appointment for the dentist, they knocked me back on several occasions.  I have a repeat prescription for Hydromal, for dermatitis, I was told it's been sorted, still no answer, several months later.  The language the nurses use it beyond the abounds of medical discourse.  Ignorance, Didn't receive any (involvement in care). No positvity."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything.
Best thing - Nothing. 
When you go up there you get fobbed off. They don't listen.  They try to tell you are all right.  Don't know what they are doing. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - Nothing.
Everything ie actually treat us like people instead of cattle, Don't automatically assume that we are wanting drugs to ???.
I'm treated like cattle, not human, I'd rather suffer than seek help.. Listening - very poor - because you's don't.
What treatment. What positive difference if I don't feel I can come to healthcare for care. 
"

Nurses XXX - change their story & don't listen to requests.  When request some the response was ""your on the waiting list"". Respect - sometimes.  Involving - never happened.  No late with meds sleep poor & feeling distress."
"Access to Services","See a doctor not a nurse.  Did nothing well - by time I saw the doctor, I was OK, after suffering for 4 weeks. The service I received was no good.  No one listened.  It was pointless even going to see doctor when I was ill because all I saw was a nurse so I've had to wait 4 weeks by this time I was ok, but suffered waiting.  Respect - They are hopeless. I didn't get no treatment as by time I saw the doctor I was ok.  Pointless even going to doctors just to be passed on to some nurse. "
"Care/ Treatment","Get a doctor appointment faster. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything. Did nothing well. Have to see nurse before doctor.  4 months for doctors appointment for a long standing condition.

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Have more doctors on recall for service."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Please don't treat everyone with negativity, some of us are genuine.  I have arthritis in my hips, lower back and I don't get  appropriate medication.  The decision is made before you hear my problems.  This is my second time to see the nurse, all is pointless because GP will give medication and I been waiting for 3 months to see GP.  All the nurses show sympathy but none are helping, just showing. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Better service, and stop giving people medication when they don't need it & give it to the people who need it.  Did nothing well. Because I have a cyst on my nose and he told me at hospital cannot do nothing for me because they haven't got any money. And I have problems with my back and he said my Mistasapen depression table got pain releaf in them that well help you. I'm getting no where with the service.  Can do nothing for you Bye! That's it from them. Bye! who next. Arrogant, Ignorant.  I've had this back pain for a long time.  I was under M.S.K on the outside before they put me in prison.  I getting on where in this system and I'm more depress than ever. "
"Care/ Treatment","More appointments, less waiting times. I saw a doctor and would only let me address one issue.  Listening - It wasn't the worst but could be better. I had a reaction to new meds 2 weeks ago but haven't heard anything.  
What did we do well? - Not a lot. "
"Access to Services","??? have waiting times down.  Put paper towels in toilets & get some new doctors that know what there doing. I think theres a lot of professionals that chat bubbles.  Too long to wait for bubbles  Can't say you don't let me know about appointments. Don't treat people like scumbags treat people like people.  Not been given any chance to have my say on matters. Been left in pain for weeks I've had to get a Solicitor involved. What did you do well? - Nothing so far. "
"Access to Services","Make things happen quicker for lads who need help.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Give us earlier appointments.  They don't listen to us.  They don't take us seriously. it takes to long to get down there and when you tell them they don't believe you. They think paracetamol sorts everything out. You don't get proper treatment here. 
Did nothing well. "
"Access to Services","Meet needs in a more timely manner.  It took over 9 months for treatment. Had no communicating. I was not told anything unless I complained.  Time scale was too long. "
"Care/ Treatment","Appointments faster.  It won't too bad.   "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Customer service is severely lacking.  Got refused pain killers ie paracetamol ?? if a dose is needed it should be given, if the patient comes regularly he should be booked to see a Dr. ??? are not outside, most of us do not work & not everybody has private cash. 
I"
"Access to Services","The dental appointments should be a lot quicker."

"Service Quality/Outcomes","Invest more money. Sometimes there is a lack of respect. I'm not always told about whats going on. "
"Access to Services","See us on time - took 10/52 to see doc, everything takes too long. Send out letters a week in advance not 2/3 weeks later.  Compared to other places they were 1/0.  Lady doing very good, everybody else no! Do discuss but never give you what you want.  Very good at convincing you, you don't need or have that. People who care should be treated ???? to these who don't care. "

"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything, from start to finish, no help.
Did nothing well. 
IP meds 10am Saturday. I have ?? Sat meaning no meds - why?"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Nurses no good.  How you speak to us.  How you deal with problems.  Appointment time.  Time.  Not paying attention. Respect - depends on who.  Involving - not at all. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Invest more time and money.  The nurses could take people seriously when they approach the watch with a concern or an injury so many people get turned away because the nurses thinks otherwise.  Better training for staff. It can take a while to see a doctor once you have reported on injury once reported on injury.  They do not take it seriously enough. It depends what the nurses are listening to and what the persons problem is about.  On the kiosk the responses are mandatory but when going to see the nurse in the watch they just try and bob you off because people on medication are priority. Show respect - Yes but as I say take people seriously when approached by prisoner with problems. When a prisoner thinks what we needs the nurses/doctors need to take on board and work with prisoners needs more.  They want to help but your are limited to a certain degree due to factors like a prison environment/security reasons. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Everything.  Did nothing well. I have broken ribs and that was 6 weeks ago I still haven't seen a doctor.  Healthcare is XXXX You've never showed respect. I've broken ribs and you've done nothing for me. "

"Communication","Make sure people are aware of appointments - I've missed a few cos I was not ??? & don't get unlocked. Still waiting to go hospital & only seen doctor months ago."
"Communication","Respond. Communication seems to be none existent within the prison system.. The doctor needs to learn very basic people skills. I witnessed total disregard, disrespect and in my opinion neglect and abuse.  I still don't know outcome of my complaint! Not had medication for 13 weeks now! Dr explanations of why not were given where they could not be met.  All other departments have failed me in a big way I feel."

"Staff/Staff Attitude","Provide us with a  counselling service. Some of the nurses could do with not being so judgmental and taking our perceived health ailment on face value.  I have at times been dismissed and felt like I was patronised by a nurse when I have tried to explain my issue.  It was as if the nurse had made her mind up that I was not ill before she had done her checks.  I feel as though the policy of keeping an individual on methadone because there is not time between a court date and reduction is not really involving me.  The decision was made for me, although I wanted off it.  "

"Access to Services","Maybe more regular sessions & opportunity to attend more often."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","You could respond to this feedback....
You could employ more staff for mental health in this prison (HMP Lincoln).  The limited amount of staff struggle to cope with the amount of people on their workload.  At the moment I'm seeing secondary mental health nurse XXX XXX once every 2 months or so.  She is so over-worked I don't know how she copes.

More information on what the assessment will contain prior to the appointment."

People abuse this system to refrain taking any responsibility for the slightest of decisions and also people who are given infinite power where others are easily corrupted and abusive. Very few things. Few staff are actually respectful. Seen a person have an accident in trousers and walk with same trousers on for days until I had to tell him that its unhygienic for us as patients to sit on same chairs as him and staff told me its not my business to get their attention. This staffs name is .... also on the same shift as .... that barely did anything. Had to get ....to get something done.

"Communication","Comments_ these comments are given based on approximately 5 months of treatment and what I have learnt personally from the nurses in attnedance. Some people are elderely and are not as assertive as myself so some of these comments are made to help them.  it is very important to note these comments are not directed to any one individual and due to recent changes draw on nurses visits past and present over the last several months of treatment.  if I had not been asked to make these comments as part of patient feedback then no comment would have been made. 1. Service received. if you base the service received on the days that I was missed or the occasions that I requested a further visit due to a malfunction of the dressing, the answer would be very poor. BUT if it was based on when all goes well and I have a regular nurse who is attentive the answer is good or even excellent. i do think there should be safeguards in the system that would stop patients being missed or would allow a return visit in a shorter time than 4 hours. 2. listening to you. I can honestly say that all nurses listen ok, but have their own individual opinions that can be confusing to the patient, this will be addressed during the answers. 3. Communicating with you. Again the nurses chat away ok but I question the SPA system? I ring SPA  who then fax the district nurses depending on their workload I have experienced up to 3.5 hours before I have had a return call from a nurse, that includes an intermediate to SPA after 2 hours to remind them. Nurses carry mobile phones, are they being used effectively. 4. staff showing respect. not a problem. 5. involving me in decisions about my care/treatment/support. this is where issues get very confusing for me the patient, this is based on not having a regular nurse at any one time,  I would advocate a nomiated nurse who must be someone other than a DN who would take the lead on both treatment and patient care, this nurse would have to visit at least once a we"

"Access to Services","It really is beyond me how we are going to lose beds at Enright close Newark, plus a greater reduction in beds in Nottinghamshire and the rest of the uk. This also matched with a reduction of community support services and staff. It is worrying for service users to say the least, community workers are similar to GPs in their role to help avoid patients needing hospital admissions and costing more money. Surely the system provided will be unbalanced, and in my opinion is an accident waiting to happen. We currently don't have enough beds. In view of current plans to reduce the amount even more, it does not make any logical sense. Charity starts at home, cut the billions of pounds of foreign aid and support your own disabled people."

"Communication","If each visit was undertakenby a specific district nurse or by a very small team Mum's recovery would I feel be accelerated. She must have been seen by a minimum of ten practitioners in the course of her treatment. This leads in my opnion to:
1. DN's not really knowing where there's been an improvement in mum's condition, or not.  Soem digital photos have been taken, which I welcome, but are no substitute for first hand experience.  These don't appear to be accessed during the home visit which I find odd.
2. A tendancy for some DN's to replace mum's dressings with what they removed, rather thanreaccess and change treatment.
3. Leads to the possibility of a lack of responsibility for the patients recovery
4. A deteriroation in mum's mental attitude because if gives the impression that she's not valued. The communication between DN's doctors surgery and then pharmacy isn't always as 'slick' as it might be
Consequently i've had to chase up prescriptions, itherwise they would not be in place for the next DN visit"

"Environment/Facilities","Maybe provide something for cleaning up the kids - I'm rubbish and forgot wipes today so had toborrow some. This is the only thing I can think of and is actually something I should do better rather than you :)"
"Care/ Treatment","Keep this (Friday morning clinic) going because it will be quicker than appointment only weigh ins"
"Communication","Ask people if they have filled in these forms before, this is my 5th time!"
"Care/ Treatment","Very welcoming for new mums.
Sometimes group could be a cliquey - might be nice to have a 'new mums' spot so we could chat to new mums"
"Environment/Facilities","I feel my child would benefit if you had the sensory room set up again"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would like to see more groups as they are brilliant"

"Access to Services","nothing happy with everything.  Apart from waiting time.  took a long time to start receiving the help she needs"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","GP work more with early health visiters came"
"Care/ Treatment","Not get rid of the weighing service! I find the communication extremely helpful, as I can touch base and ask any questions I am not sure about.
If I'm worried about anything  i cant talk to the GP about, I would come on a thursday to ask my Health Visitor while weighing baby."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I heard on the news that there will be some cut back on Health Visitors.  It is not good because lots of people are having babies and we need more Health Visitors like Leanne."

"Access to Services",". I am sad to hear they wont have the Health Visitor and weigh in group as I find this very helpful."
"Access to Services","Continue the baby clinic instead of the self weighing"
"Access to Services","Continue to offer a weighing service as I feel there are so many problems being created through stopping it. Self weigh is subject to parents being able to read a scale, know how to plot on a graph and recognise when to ask for help."
"Access to Services","Excellent service.
I am a little concerned regarding the new weighing arrngements. My coincern is from a safeguarding perspective for vulnerable families, eg parents with learning difficulties etc. I would like to request that this approach is removed and a Health Worker is present for weigh ins."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","You dont see the same nurse very often."
"Environment/Facilities","Make sure there are enough dressings and applications. Should be more on a par because some are better than others!!"

"Environment/Facilities","Better car parking"
"Care/ Treatment","Quicker appointments"

"Care/ Treatment","Keep weigh-in a weekly group at Cotgrave surgery."
"Care/ Treatment","Not cancelling weigh in clinic."

"Access to Services","have more regular appointments, but this would mean more podiatrists and more expence"

"Communication","Sign post the physio department better from the main corridor"
"Access to Services","Be available in the evenings for people who are just released from hospital, not just for emergencies. However, the support we had from Yvonne was really helpful and positive."
"Access to Services","I is so important to have a Health Visitor with whom you have a relationship so that you feel able to go to them with any worry without feeling inadequate or judged. I have had this to date at Calverton Health Centre and cant imagine how things would have turned out without it. I was a new parent without local support, and the reassurance I got from the Health Centre, particularly Vickie Duke mad such a difference to me. I am very unhappy the the Health Service is reducing named HV's and many vulnerable parents and children will be missed in a potentially life threatening way This is so detremental to the well being of women and babys."
"Access to Services","I think it is going to have a negative affect on the overall Health Visiting service by introducing self weighing, as this is an important opportunity to discuss issues and concerns in a friendly environment."
"Access to Services","More drop in clinics in Calverton.
More sessions from the Health visitors on child development please."
"Access to Services","Dont change baby clinic to appointment only."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More time with the Health Visitor"

"Access to Services","Have a Lets Talk team to see like a drop in centre. then waiting months on end."

"Environment/Facilities","Send a map showing where centre is.
Tell about parking facilities nearby"

"Service Quality/Outcomes","I normally love this group but today a lot of the children were very messy to the point it made it hard for my child to play. I think there should be rules that if your child just empties boxes out they or you should help tidy it so other can play."
"Food","Allow adults to have tea"
"Access to Services","just waiting rather a long time for an appointment but you are limited by the number of people you have available "

"Access to Services","Support earlier ie 0-6months."
"Care/ Treatment","appointment was changed quite a number of times.  Maybe a better system to make appointments?"
"Access to Services","It would be better if we still had a healht visitor present at weigh in's as I find it very helpful."
"Access to Services","I am extremely concerned about the cuts to the Health Visiting Team, especially having needed their help myself both for my baby and myself. It is essential Health Visitors havee direct contact with people to ensure no problems with babies or mums get missed. People wont ring someone they dont know and have no continuity. It's impossible to pick up problems with babies health and mums health eg post natal depression without visiting and seeing them in person."
"Communication","some receipes would be nice."
"Communication","chek understanding of some patients as where lwss clear information given."
"Communication","some improvement on presentation skills. Training?"

This means I cannot always get an appointment when needed at GP's and their nurse is not as good at taking blood as Park House. IT'S DISGUSTING."

"Care/ Treatment","i have found the self weight clinics more difficult i miss the reassurance of the assisisted clinics and found it more difficult to know if the weight gain is enough"
"Care/ Treatment","Maybe 2 half day sessions would be better so you dont get bombarded wiht too much info in one go, and have time to process the info and come back wiht questins to the 2nd session. However this would be more dfifficult for working people - 2 days off instead of one."
"Access to Services","Maybe to encourage the NHS/GP Practice to allow a follow up HBA1C test after a few months post DESMOND course to see if things are having a positive effect."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Regarding the weighing clinic at Richard Herrod Centre. I am very disappointed that this will not be run by Health Visitor.I think it will severely affect how myself and other women ask for help.If there is a problem this could be missed. I think this is a poor decision and will affect baby developments, and not support women with anxiety issues."
"Access to Services","Keep the Health Visitors at baby weigh in sessions! Having Health Visitors available to ask questions to and reach a large amount of people at once is invaluable.If unsure of something it is good to be able to ask a question which you dont think would warrent an appointment. Face to face relationships are much better than a phone call and to be able to check the baby in person."
"Access to Services","My son and I attend the baby and weigh in group at the Richard Herrod Centre and the breast feeding group at Park House. We thoroughly enjoy the sessions and find them invaluable in giving us help and support by professionals and other parents. Not only is it educational, it is fun too! Also the home visits by the Health Visitor is vital support for my ptnr and I providing much needed help and advice."

The breast feeding group at the same time before christmas used to be so popular-why was this changed? I think that if Health Visitors were doing the weighing then more people would use the serviceand the play group. I have been told that I will have to use Killisick for a playgroup, for me this means driving rather than walking, how sad. Playgroups are valuable groups that allow sometimes isolated parents to socialise and allow children to meet new people. I hope there will be a different  group set up on Thursdays, what a shame the Arnbrook facilities will be left unused."

"Access to Services","This is a general feedback relating to Health Visiting services. I had my son at the end of 2016, so have not experienced HV clinics. I therefore cannot directly compare the current appointment system. However, I feel that the previous system would be far superior. 1) Regularly seeing the same person is a better way for them to see your progress/get to know you and your baby. HVs can see problems before you are even aware, preventing future problems arising. 2) Reassurance - the amount of stress new Mums feel could be greatly reduced by simply being able to ask ""is this normal?"" 3) Social aspect - good for Mums' mental health to be able to have somewhere to go regularly and see people in same situation as them,along with people who can help. 4) Getting help in a timely manner. Both myself and numerous Mums have admitted we waited until a problem became ""big enough"" to warrant an appointment. This is a dangerous precedent. Babies' health and Mums' mental health are being put at risk.  I am very aware of pressures of finance, however, I strongly believe this is not the correct place to apply cuts. All Mums I have spoken to want HV clinic."

"Communication","The explaination techniques seems to involve alot of making partipitants answer the questions from the start. It would be helpful if these could be specific, less ambigious.

"Access to Services","More visits please."
"Access to Services","111 takes too long"
"Environment/Facilities","The toilet flush mechanism is extremely difficult to press and in an awkward position. The bed rails (because they're lowered) can catch the backs of legs when getting out of bed. The light switch is not easy to reach when lying in bed. A switch on either the bed hand-set or call button would be better.  More access to physiotherapy also required - we were told that daily physio sessions would be provided but this did not happen."

"Access to Services","X has made slow but steady progress with one-to-one physiotherapy he has received from X. Unfortunately seven sessions is not nearly enough for him to continue to improve his mobility and gain more use of his arm.

As it is you cool down waiting to do something else. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Do some outside for a true test."
"Access to Services","Nothing I can think of. I was waiting quite a long time to be seen (I was here for 2.5 hours in total), but given that the Health Visitor only referred me that morning and i was given a slot at the feeding clinic the same day I really didn't mind - it just meant I had to rush off in the end."

"Access to Services","Maybe have few more groups on throughout the week."
"Communication","Would be great to see more new mums - maybe look to how to encourage more people to come."
"Access to Services","Another play session in a morning for toddlers"
"Access to Services","The referral process took a long time from my initial diagnosis and then I was assessed for the wrong treatment. A speedier process would obviously have helped me to start improving sooner. The treatment I have received I have found beneficial. "
"Access to Services","I understand the financial limitations of your service but I needed real help earlier and I would have preferred actual face-face counselling.   Other comments made on specific questions were - Q2(option of therapy) - Phone counselling was recommended. Q4 (offered choice of worker) - no but Tracy (Wright) was very perceptive and understanding. "
"Access to Services","- Lots of cancellations made for ""training"". - Cancellations for sickness. - Repetative work, felt like I was confused with another patient. - Sessions were 1-2 weekly which I felt wasn't enough. + Sleep workshop was excellent. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was notified of a cancelled 1-1 appointment with less than 24 hours notice. No follow up appointment was made despite an email request. This poor service left me feeling despondent and not valued. These anxieties and feelings matched my original reasons for seeking your help. "
"Access to Services","I waited for 4-5 weeks for an appointment in December. Then I couldn't see a counsellor till January. When you feel at your worst, the timescale appears immense. "
"Access to Services","A longer period of therapy ie, more sessions as mine is a long term condition 6 sessions is not enough."
"Access to Services","Quicker appointments would lessen the time spent with anxiety. "
"Care/ Treatment","I don't think that this was the correct treatment for me at all. I am lonely and was expecting counselling not filing a form out to see if I was about to commit suicide! I have never been, nor will I ever be there. So I don't feel it helped me at all though everyone was very nice, if a little condensending. Thank you anyway."
"Access to Services","More time should be allowed for each session. Only half an hour was allowed per session. because it takes time to get into your actual problems, and by that time it would be the end of the session. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I have problems with phones. I don't like to use them and don't believe its the way to sort issues like mine. If I were having a bad day then I would just ignore the phone therefore you would only speak to me when I felt ok which is the point I don't need help. My problems are not solved I've just realised there is no point in continuing with the help. I understand now that I will always be depressed and always be alone which makes everything else pointless. If I were given a week to live I would be relieved not upset thats the best way to explain how I feel. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Therapist said if I had everything going on and I wasn't stressed then she would be worried. So still very stressed and on anti-depressants but nothing therapy can do about it. "
"Access to Services","The amount of sessions needed should be a guided patient choice and more person centred"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The treatment was ok and the therapist was very caring and tried to be helpful but I don't think her help was necessary in my case and as it turned out it wasn't much help as I had another attack and the treatment she suggested made no difference at all. However, if I ever felt that I did have a psychological problem I would not hesitate to use the service again, so thank you. "
"Access to Services","You need more resources and team members as your waiting list is too long. "
"Access to Services","I have had excellent results and my only complaint is the time I waited to access your service and / signposted to your service by my GP."
"Communication","More communication on the length of time you have to wait, having to ring and chase was a big stress to me at the start of the counselling. The option to extend the course by a couple of sessions if both parties felt the need to do so rather than having to be re referred. I don't want to relapse without the support. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I found it helpful to see the same person as last time. I had to wait longer for my first appointment but saved time in the long run. "
"Access to Services","Not sure of your work load. Had to wait a month to see a therapist. "
"Access to Services","Hope to carry this on once I have settled back into normal routines as we have just moved house."
"Involvement","I was offered only one type of treatment and was not made aware of any alternative."
"Access to Services","When I initially was referred/consulted the service the waiting time was short but once the initial assessment was made a telephone follow up was not for approximately one month then that was rearranged. . "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have liked the opportunity to try a different counsellor as I relate better to men often but maybe this is something I could try when I am readmitted to CBT later in the year after my bereavement counselling? I liked my counsellor but I didn't feel I could open up about everything for some reason - probably my problem."
"Access to Services","If there is a long waiting time befor / after initial appointment (3 weeks+ a call to say you've not been forgotten with an approximate date would be very useful - I worried about it alot. "
"Access to Services","Just would have preferred to have got an appointment sooner than I did. I know thats not always possible but the waiting was terrible because of how I felt at that the time. "
"Privacy and Dignity","It would be helpful if clinicians did not talk about their own experiences rather than treating me. I also thought it was unprofessional to name and talk about University colleagues I work with as part of the discussion about my feelings. I hope my confidentiality is respected and that I will not be discussed either with other patients or staff. "
"Access to Services","Sessions should be a little longer for service users as stress levels change as well as circumstances."
"Access to Services","When going through mental health issues, intervention/treatment needs to be immediate for most effectiveness. Conditions can deteriorate within hours to the point of suicide and at the very least continued suffering can make recovery longer and can be very damaging generally. You wouldn't leave a broken leg for weeks before treatment! Mental health is just as severe if not more life threatening than a broken leg sometimes and I feel I should be treated with that in mind. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am still no better off. I feel stressed, annoyed really had no-one to talk to. Was offered but nothing came of it. Still feel pent up anger. Feeling withdrawn in myself not wanting to go out. Why change my treating officer when I was starting to feel confident; the knock me back to where I was is not good practice. "
"Access to Services","My symptoms reduced only with the use of medication and I am likely to need your services once the medication is withdrawn. I would have appreciated more 16 30 mins sessions instead of 8 60 mins sessions. "
"Access to Services","More sessions"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I didn't feel I got anywhere with Jane then she went on sick and all I was told is that I couldn't have an appointment until she was back and that could of been weeks or more. I wasn't offered another therapist. It was only because I kept ringing and ringing to see if Jane was back (I kept getting told they didn't know when this would be) and only after this was I told I could see someone else who actually was a lot better. If I had not called I would of been left waiting and wondering when I would next see someone. And at this point I was very suicidal. If I hadn't kep phoning and pestering I'd of been left without treatment when I needed it most. "
"Access to Services","I needed counselling and then was referred to Framework for help. I was not allowed counselling and help from Framework which I would have liked. I felt I would have benefited from both for a short period of time. I had to drop the counselling. Framework have been fantastic and I am grateful for their help. "
"Access to Services","Overall the information and help received was excellent. The only thing I was dissatisfied and a little upset by was the fact that at the start of my sessions I was told that I had 30 minutes for the 1st and 20 minutes for the second session. It made me feel that the counsellors time was more important than my need to pour out my feelings and get assistance for how I feel and what can help me improve my state of mind. I discussed this with my doctor who was amazed that a time limit was mentioned at all. He was also surprised that I had to ring myself to make an appointment with a bereavement counsellor which was the best option for me at the present time. I would like to say that Julianne and Krieanna were both lovely to speak to and very helpful but it would perhaps be better not to put a time limit on the sessions. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt I could not open up to my therapist as much as I would like to of do as she made me feel quite uneasy at times and I do feel I would benefit from more treatment in the future from a different therapist. "
"Access to Services","After only two sessions and only talking about one aspect of my anxiety I'm not sure it has helped at all. Because I was quite a while getting to see someone and because my anxiety only last about 12 weeks I was starting to feel better before I saw anyone I'm still not sure if there is anyway I can help myself to avoiding anxiety in the future and that worries me. "
"Access to Services","The Service needs to be expanded. More therapists, shorter waiting times and the chance for follow up appointments."
"Access to Services","My only suggestion for improvement would be the time delay to the first appointment though I appreciate that resources are stretched to the limit at present. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I did not feel this service was helping me. In fact, I got very agitated before the meetings. I cannot seem to get myself motivated by the therapy probably because I am so negative. "
"Access to Services","I have basically been refused sessions of CBT and/or counselling as I have to work shifts and cannot guarantee I will be available at x hours on x day for the foreseeable future. That is disgusting. The lovely ladies I spoke to both said I am in dire need of help but the services are inflexible - useless. If I ever do commit suicide I'm blaming the Tories and sending a copy to the press! The two staff I did speak to were fantastic. Its the PROTOCOL I'm furious and disgusted by. "
"Access to Services","The written information I received complete with worksheets were very helpful. However, I did not receive any feedback concerning this from my therapist. The additional information I was supposed to receive after my last phone call never arrived. "
"Access to Services","It would help if there wasn't a time limit on treatment. Also, I feel the questionnaire that you fill in every session are not a very good way of seeing how treatment is progressing eg., you may be ok for 3 days and on day you complete forms you are feeling down. "
"Access to Services","I understand it is statutory 6 appointments, but I think in most cases you would only be breaking through the tip of the iceberg. Would have liked other options available taught breathin exercises/meditate/other strategies etc."
"Access to Services","Very slow from referral to treatment start which could be problematic. However, once on program, Tres was great and I now have a very positive view of the service. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Possibly could help in time but at the moment feel really down. "
"Access to Services","Seemed a very long wait for first appointment. In my opinion this could be vital in some cases of depression or anxiety. Just seeing someone was a great help to me but sooner rather than later would, I think, be better. "
"Environment/Facilities","A pleasant and comfortable environment to have my appointments. Much better than a doctor's surgery or hospital mental health department. "
"Care/ Treatment","The only other treatment I would like is the option of hynotherapy, although this doesn't appear to be available through the NHS and no one can recommend me on. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","insufficient therapists available  The waiting time for an appointment was lengthy but the treatment I received from my therapist was excellent. "
"Access to Services","There needs to be more appointments in Worksop; I was seen in Retford. "
"Access to Services","My feelings regarding stress management classes and the way my non-attendance of the later sessions was handled remains one of deep disappointment and dissatisfaction. "
"Access to Services","I was referred in November 2011. Because I asked for evening appointments I was not offered a session until August 2012 by which time I had gotten over the episode by myself. I understand the service is stretched financially and with staff shortages but waiting almost a year for help is unacceptable."
"Access to Services","As I work full days I was not able to have a face to face session. This service would have been even more helpful if there was a late night/out of hours session for me to attend. "
"Access to Services","Gary was treating me with CBT but he thought I really needed to see a counsellor. He is no longer with you and he discharged me from your services which I was disappointed a bout really. I was hoping to have support in decreasing my dose of dosulepin. However, I am pleased to know that I can ask my doctor to refer me if needed again to you. "
"Access to Services","What about follow up? I was doing well while I was under CBT but now that support hasn't been there, I feel I've gone back to where I was. I felt ready at the time but it hasn't had a lasting effect - not long enough for me to get back on track like we both hoped and expected I would. "
"Access to Services","Perhaps the initial GP referral could have been quicker. I did feel I was being pushed down the road of anti-depressants. "
"Access to Services","I know if I need help again, I have to go back to my GP. I would have preferred to be able to ring your services without having to do this - although you explained the reasons which I accept. "
"Access to Services","My therapist left that's why my treatment ended now I have to wait on a list to see someone else, learn to trust them, get stressed going to first appointment - its all a waiting game!  Why open up to someone when they leave then you just get put on a list?"
"Communication","Halfway through counselling the room was completely changed around. This threw me off and I did not feel safe in that room anymore. I felt on edge. That should never have happened. "
"Access to Services","The amount of time between being discharged from initial therapy to an appointment arriving for more intenstive treatment is unacceptable to someone feeling depressed and unable to cope. The appointment arrived whilst I was away and was within the same week. It was missed and I was referred back to GP. This is also unacceptable and very disappointing. "
"Access to Services","The time delay from doctors to initial assessment was too long - I know you must be busy but when you are at the worst a quick response is encouraging. "
"Access to Services","At the time of assessment it was agreed that I would benefit from counselling however, as there was a 4 month wait for treatment this was not an option for me as I needed help to deal with immediate/urgent issues. This made me feel despondent and helpless at the time. With one session of stress management I was lucky enough to be able to get my issues into perspective to help myself. However, had counselling been immediately available I feel I would have had a better chance of long term help with solutions to my problems."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Found the brochures on anxiety really useful. But the CBT without talking about what had actually happened to cause it I thought was strange. Without the therapist knowing the background I can't see how the treatment can be specific enough to help. "
"Communication","There was a bit of a problem with the information being sent by post. Each time the therapist sent information to me it did not arrive. When I told her she said there was problem with the mailing system. "
"Access to Services","Had to wait 5 months for an appointment which when you have asked for help is a very long time and a lot of things can change. I would have liked more information about how I would feel whilst receiving counselling. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Although the telephone consultations worked ok and I can understand that there are financial constraints. I feel that a more personal, face to face approach for me at least would have worked better. "
"Access to Services","A patient should have more than half an hour for treatment. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The situation I am in with my anxiety means I could not work without feeling very ill. I am lucky and do not have to work but feel that there should be something I could do to mean I could work. "
"Communication","Clearer information that first visit appointment is for assessment. No time limit or restriction on number of sessions. Follow up after treatment is 6 months etc., to make sure support still there even if it is not needed. Possibility of groups/gatherings to self help with people of similar problems. "
"Access to Services","I have finished self management of long term health issues. I am still waiting for appointment with ISAS. I have had an assessment but up to 4 months waiting list. "
"Care/ Treatment","I believe I was offered the wrong treatment and should of been offered counselling to discuss my past not my anxiety. "
"Communication","Whist I understand the need to avoid ""DNA"" for appointments I found the constant need to confirm appointments (as per standard letters) almost contraindicative when particularly low. I interpreted this as saying my appointment wasn't really that important and was tempted not to attend. "
"Access to Services","Client very unhappy about length of time, from first contact to being offerd therapy. Feels he had improved, by the time he was seen"
"Access to Services","Although I said I didn't need Tom anymore, I believe maybe could have done with couple of smaller follow up maybe 10 mins appointments to make sure I really was ok. "
"Access to Services","More sessions please we only just begun."
"Care/ Treatment","I asked for longer between appointments to assimilate and work on things. This was very important to be and instead of having to ask if it could be offered. Also, although it looks like you are taking longer it is time well spent. I said this at my last appointment. "
"Access to Services","Overall the waiting time is quite lengthy. I thought it might have been 9 months but it ended up being 6. I could have done with it immediately but I realise this is not realistic in the eyes of service providers. I was hoping it would be 9 months in the end as I am currently seeing 2 other counsellors and to see a third would be too overwhelming. Regrettably, I have had to decline this service at this time. Ideally, I would like to have postponed until January/February 2013, instead I have to be re-referred after my other counselling is due to end in December. I thought if the waiting time is 9 months I could have had time to process the other counselling before commencing with Let's Talk Wellbeing. Now I will have to be re-referred and waiting another undisclosed amount of time. At least I will have plenty of time to process my other counselling before coming to see you again. The service I received was helpful and my options were explained regarding taking on a third counsellor. I had plenty of time and no pressure to think and come to the conclusion that this course of action was the best way to proceed at this time. "
"Access to Services","I found it hard to comment on some questions as I only had 2 telephone calls. I did feel like I had to wait a while to get an appointment which I needed the help straight away really. Then my therapist was ill which cannot be helped but would have been nice if I could have seen someone else to get the help faster. "
"Access to Services","That patients can be seen sooner after assessment I waited 6/12 and things can change."
"Access to Services","Just need the time of treatments to be extended not restricted. "
"Access to Services","Would have liked longer sessions. "
"Access to Services","From my initial appointment, the waiting time to start CBT was approximately 8 months. At the time this was far too long to wait but my treatment and therapist were fantastic. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","My therapist was off ill for a while and I felt quite isolated for a time. "
"Communication","Sometimes find it difficult speaking over the telephone. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was happy to talk to people about my anxiety and I know that its very general and a difficult case where there may not be much to do to help. However, although both counsellors I saw were nice, they basically just said ""you're determined so just carry on how you are"" which is exactly what I didn't want to hear. I was seeking treatment in order to stop being how I am now. So now I have no idea what to do and don't feel any better. "
"Communication","I thought I would be able to see one of the other psychologists through CBT because of my traumatic episodes but I was convinced to see a psychologist at hospital on the unit because you only classed my emotional/mental wellbeing and not looked at anything physical in my terms. I may be misunderstood - please clarify as soon as possible with an appointment. "
"Access to Services","I was satisfied with the time taken to receive an initial appointment with the Service for initial assessment - within approx 4 weeks. However I was extremely dissatisfied in the time taken to receive my first appointment for treatment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have preferred a one to one with a therapist rather than having my treatment over the phone. This way I feel my therapist would have had a bigger overall picture of my needs. "
"Access to Services","The wait time for my first session was shockingly long. It was ok for me in a way as I was/am not terribly depressed or suicidal but I do feel that something needs to be done about this very long waiting time. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I had four different appointments and I saw 3 different people. I would have preferred to see the same person to be able to create trust. I had to repeat myself to each differnt person. One counsellor was clock watching. I didn't feel it had any benefit to  my mental health or physical health. They were very young and I would have preferred someone with more maturity and experience. I believe I need a fully qualified professional psychiatrist to assist me with my mental health. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would have preferred to have one-one at a venue not on the phone. How could they tell how I was feeling, body language, etc. Still have a very long way to go. Still find closed spaces a big challenge and will avoid if I can. I feel six sessions wasn't enough to cope with all the phobias I have and feel most of it I have done myself. "
"Access to Services","Waiting time was horrendous due to how bad I already felt."
"Communication","I was initially dissatisfied as doctors surgery didn't make an appointment until 2 weeks later due to admin error."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I didn't feel that the phone treatment was the best way. I would have preferred face to face on a one to one basis. The questions that I was asked at the start of each session were impossible and totally degrading. I don't feel as though I have benefited at all from your service and will now be going to private counselling organised through my employer. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I felt I needed more time between modules to absorb their effect. "
"Access to Services","Lovely young lass but I felt the ladies(?) that referred(?) were quite on a time limit and this showed, feeling awkward "
"Access to Services","Ian was very good with me and after being under Ian I came a long way but he gave me one goal to do and that was to go round a supermarket on my own. I still haven't done this goal for him. I think I have had a setback as I am feeling the same again. Think I should see my doctor for another referral. "
"Care/ Treatment","I appreciate the help I received and it did help me recognise the issues I have but I also feel that I could greatly benefit from a different form of therapy (psychotherapy) but I was told I would have to wait at least six months before I could even apply for the treatment. This is greatly distressing to me. "
"Communication","Could do with information about groups in Retford that would help with nerves. At present, my daughter helps but could do with outside in case she can't help as much as she likes to. "
"Access to Services","More session 6 is not enough"
"Communication","Can you please explain the charts. How do they work. What is good/bad points. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I expected help with issues after an operation that went unexpectedly badly. I ended up with a psychology lesson about nerves and Belvita breakfast biscuits. Pointless less about things I already knew. "
"Communication","Didn't know what was happening. All I had was a woman (not sure who she was qualification wise) who read leaflets to me telling me what depression was and who I said many times looking at her watch so this was a waste of my time and hers and hasn't helped at all which is why I decided to stop seeing her. "
"Communication","I feel my problem is going to be for a lifetime as my whole family and relations have had the same problems. Some are on treatment still. I feel somebody like me need to carry some sort of card like a kidney donor card or giving blood because people at work just don't understand how bad it is. "
"Access to Services","I had to wait over two weeks to have my first ""screening"" appointment with Julianne Wright. She told me that several of the team were off ill and that it would take 1-2 weeks to have my case taken on by one of the CBT team. When I didn't hear anything after 3 weeks I phoned to see what had happened. I was given an appointment in Worksop which was then cancelled. Finally, I was given another appointment with Julianne Wright. During this appointment she apologised about having to wait so long for an appointment and explained it was because she had lost my notes after my screening appointment - apparently she had gone off ill again immediately after seeing me (she had just come back from sick leave). Whilst waiting over 4 weeks to have a therapy session with a member of the CBT team, I was suffering from stress, anxiety and severe depression because of work commitments. I had lost nearly two stone in weight and wasn't eating. My husband was very worried about me. Thus, I began to see a private psychotherapist. Imagine my frustration then when I finally managed to have my first proper therapy session with Julianne Wright on hearing her tell me that I would either have to give up CBT or my private psychotherapist because having two types of therapies doesn't work. Given the track record of the CBT team, I chose to keep my private therapist. Therefore my experience of trying to gain help from the CBT team is one of frustration and high dissatisfaction. Illness seems to pervade the CBT team and there seems to be a great deal of lack of communication. I was lucky enough to be able to pay for private help, but I feel sorry for anyone who has to rely on this service for help! It's simply not good enough!"
"Access to Services","I originally attended the stress control group followed by CBT treatment. My answers refer to the CBT treatment. I was waiting a long time between the two treatments and feel that if I hadn't contacted you regarding an appointment, I would have waited even longer. "
"Access to Services","Although the sessions have helped I am still having issues. Since finishing the sessions I am now dealing with one of the issues discussed all over again (infection of mice at work for second time whilst pregnant causing risk to baby with little support from work). I would of liked more than six sessions mainly until the end of my pregnancy. But I seek some comfort that I will be able to speak to peri-natal at the end of April. "
"Access to Services","Purely as a personal preference I would have liked meetings to have taken place at the GP Surgery."
"Access to Services","When I was first referred, I was in a pretty bad place and under the care of the Crisis Team. I was not too happy to wait for 6 weeks for the appointment but can understand why. "
"Access to Services","Service good once got an appointment. A six month wait for treatment seems unacceptable (okay for me  in the end). For severely depressed people or those thinking of harming themselves the length of wait could have very bad consequences & importantly makes people feel that even the professionals paid to care don't care - not a good message for people suffering from mental health problems"
"Access to Services","I would have liked to have been able to have more sessions"
"Access to Services","On my first appointment the therapist didn't turn up; he had mixed the time up or something. For someone who was quite ill this would have been a very bad experience. He was late for the second appointment. I also found it negative to be asked ot fill in a form in a waiting room and indeed, not good to fill one in at all. Surely its better to talk to people. I came because I had lost a bit of confidence with driving and large groups of people. This experience could have made another person worse. The lady I first met was much better!"
"Access to Services","The initial referral to a telephone therapist was MORE stressful for me and made my distress worse! Once I was referred to a 1-1 , face to face counselling with a therapist who worked with me to work through my distress I could see the benefits straight away! thankyou."
"Access to Services","A reduction in time between initial referral from GP 9Jan 2012) to first appointment (end Aug 2012) 7 months a long time if someone was feeling more unstable than I was myself."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I didn't feel any benefit from treatment whatsoever. Don't know why. My state is the same and I am unsure where to go next. "
"Access to Services","Felt that the time between my first session (26.10.2011) and second session (19.1.2012) was far too long. "
"Access to Services","The only negative I can comment on is the waiting time as usually when you ask for help your at the point where you really need it not 6 + weeks down the line. "
"Access to Services","Though very satisfied with the therapist and satisfied overall, I still feel I need and would benefit from further help and will probably consult my GP most likely after Christmas. One stark realisation I have had at long last, since finishing with you is that I can no longer do things I feel I should be capable of doing but I am finding it very had to take. "
"Access to Services","It was suggested I try counselling now. I am just disappointed that I have had to go elsewhere because of the long waiting list you have. (I have got in touch with the Farr Centre and they have a 2 month waiting list) I have been really impressed with the service I have received. "
"Access to Services","Feel that people who have suffered from depression and other issues need more time and help to change. Although I found Angela very helpful. "
"Communication","It would have been helpful to be told what was significant in the replies I gave during consultations. The enclosed graphs don't mean a lot without accompanying notes. "
"Access to Services","I think it is a shame if the time you get with your counsellor is cut by half because I think you need time to discuss and resolve your problems properly. "
"Access to Services","With relation to Q3, the reason for the neutral answer is because until another potential situation arises which makes me feel the way I initially did and I put in place what waa discussed, I do not know whether it will help me or not.   With relation to Q1. The initial contact was the time when I needed the help the most and was most vulnerable and ? an earlier contact would have alleviated the vulnerability earlier. I understand that it is difficult to fit someone in straight away so therefore not sure what the answer/solution is. "
"Care/ Treatment","Think the things about self harm should not be so much in your face to remind you. "
"Care/ Treatment","For a service aimed at people who are depressed, you didn't have any problems constantly cancelling via my answerphone and being totally unreachable when I tried to re-schedule - still depressed!"
"Access to Services","When I was first referred I was pretty unstable and the wait for the first appointment could have been a period when I deteriorated/took inappropriate action. When my first appointment was not fulfilled, I became very angry and probably acted inappropriately at the meeting place (Retford Bridgegate Surgery)."
"Communication","I didn't find the way that the weekly/fortnightly response form was particularly easy to answer. I stopped the course voluntarily as I am now on a one-to-one support programme for carers of mentally ill suffferers. "
"Access to Services","Perhaps a 6 month review and the option to self refer rather than have to go via GP again"
"Care/ Treatment","My only negative comment is that I don't think 30 minute slots are quite long enough to go through things. "
"Access to Services","At the beginning it was ok but when Emma left it took nearly six months of sorting out appointments. After letters of complaint from myself due times arranged for phone calls from the therapist that did not happen.   Tracy was great and helped me out. "
"Access to Services","I would have liked longer sessions as my circumstances changed half way through - Need some more, which I am in the process of arranging."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would suggest that the client be matched age wise with the therapist. "
"Access to Services","I missed the first session and the last 2. If possible, I would like to go to the meetings again. "
"Access to Services","Had to wait to get assessed which when you are feeling unwell is the last thing you want. Only spoke over the phone with therapist which felt quite inpersonal, the sessions sometimes felt rushed or cut short and made me feel I was one of many just to get through. Once when I had to cancel an appointment and was told would be contacted to make another, the next thing I received was a letter saying I would be discharged back to my doctor if I was not in touch within 14 days (received two of these letters - lack of communication). The therapist who I spoke to helped me think of things differently and sent me some notes on health anxiety which were helpful. Overall, I think improvements can be made to make your service better. "
"Access to Services","By the time my appointment was sorted it had taken over three months. Luckily with the medication from my doctor I was feeling much better by this time, but feel sorry for others who aren't so lucky. Things need to be speeded up a lot. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I recommend that when you take on a new client you make sure the worker/therapist is going to be with them through their treatment. I've opened up twice to various therapists only to be told I would have to change to someone else. It is not easy for me to open up so I've felt very let down. I know its not the therapist's fault if they change jobs but feel more could be done when placing a therapist with a new client. "
"Access to Services","Did not feel thoroughly or appropriately assessed in the initial consultation and thereafter did not feel I was receiving the appropriate level of treatment. Felt it was not involved or relevant enough and was not benefiting in any way so was very disappointed after initial high hopes of level of care I would receive. Did not assist in any way. "
"Access to Services","Treatment should be made available before the ultimate breakdown occurs. Unfortunately, without a questionnaire you do not see the signs of mental illness. I had to be told I was ill. I did not see therapy as a treatment but as guidance to resolve issues. I would suggest work based questionnaires. "
"Access to Services","Only negative was the length of time I had to wait for my first appointment. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would have preferred a more mature experienced counsellor. Having been referred for an anxiety/panic disorder I was sent booklets about depression. Don't think my real problem has been addressed. "
"Access to Services","More sessions available for treatment. I personally feel that I would benefit from more sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","Didn't like the group format."
"Access to Services","I wished I had been able to have more appointments than what there was with Jayne. Just feel that I needed more for my relaxation and able to talk to her in the one-to-one which I had. "
"Care/ Treatment","I cannot recall being offered a choice of treatment. The treatment I received, although I have no fault with the therapist, I found distressing and inconclusive. It did not help me really to listen to someone telling me what I had just said!! I know one size doesn't fit all so I suppose this is helpful for some people. "
"Record Keeping","It really helped to discuss with a third party about what had been happening in my work place. Although in the letter to my doctor - Dr. Brownson - it was stated that I had been in a difficult situation with a previous partner - in fact it was the head teacher where I previously worked, not a partner. Could you please amend this. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There is not one treatment that suits everyone which is what GPs seem to think. The doctor seemed to not care about any progress. He wasjust happy to be handing me over. It's GPs that need the education. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Face to face therapy sessions worked much better for me than telephone conversations which I found were of little benefit. My sincere thanks to Karen for her help and support. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Need to offer face to face option at onset; impression was the only option was by phone. "
"Access to Services","I wish I had of got it sooner but my counsellor (Tres Roche) was a really genuinely nice and friendly person that helped me a lot during the difficult time and learnt me to deal with future occurences better. Thank you. "
"Access to Services","I had almost solved the problem on my own before I came for my first appointment as it took so long. From seeing my doctor to the first appointment was nearly six weeks then after first appointment then seven week wait for next one.   Lisa Richardson is fantastic, a credit to your service. "
"Access to Services","It did take a long time to get an assessment but first appointment followed very quickly. "
"Access to Services","Would have been helpful to see therapist quicker from assessment to first appointment but understand on waiting list. Therapist was brilliant. "
"Communication","Would prefer that the therapist had access to full up-to-date communication equipment, laptop, smartphone as to facilitate a modern service"
"Access to Services","I was taken off the waiting list by mistake therefore I had to wait a year to be seen. "
"Access to Services","Would like shorter waiting list and more sessions available - and longer session duration"
"Access to Services","Less waiting time, more sessions, shorter periods between sessions"
"Access to Services","Sessions were based on 6-8. Maybe more sessions available to each person."
"Access to Services","I think that the waiting time was very long and needs to be shortened.  "
"Care/ Treatment","I liked it after work time.  It was a bit slow paced for me."
"Access to Services","I think the first appointment could have been quicker as i had to wait almost 3 months."
"Communication","A clearer plan from the sessions will be used. More open ended comments sections on forms rather than being asked to circle numbers."
"Access to Services","The waiting time was very long (5 months) and I needed help when I first phoned. My doctor gave me the leaflet but it would have been better if he did the referral as I wasn't in the right state of mind to be left to do it myself."
"Access to Services","Nothing apart from waiting time before getting a counsellor Happy with Service Counsellor has helped a lot."
"Care/ Treatment","Don't know or appreciate what was happening in the first few weeks but the final 3 sessions seemed to click into place and turned my thinking around. "
"Care/ Treatment","When reviewing therapy with the client it should be considered that perhaps a CBT routine may have been better suited to this client as she has found it very difficult working with her emotions."
"Communication","Helpful to be seen as a person not a number"
"Access to Services","Would like longer"
"Access to Services","'Shorter waiting time for the first appointment'"
"Access to Services","It would have been nicer to have the therapy earlier on when I was referred, as I was struggling more actively with my PTSD at the time. Had EMDR for PTSD and felt the treatment was the most appropriate for PTSD. Had previously had counselling in the past and it had not addressed the issues properly, whereas EMDR has successfully addressed all of the related problems. "
"Access to Services","A long waiting period due to changes in your structuring.  "
"Access to Services","I was able to trust my therapist and work with her but wish I could have seen her for longer sessions."
"Access to Services","I would not change any of the treatment or care that I had, I just had to wait a long time because I was referred to the wrong therapist (male) which meant I had to wait longe. "
"Access to Services","I was happy with the treatment I had, but feel that we could have worked more in depth with the issues if more sessions were available. I valued the trust built up but it was very short lived and I would have liked to say more thiings that would have added to the therapy."
"Communication","Info on diet. How the brain reacts to stress etc."
"Access to Services","Waiting time lengthy before first appointment Room environment can help patient to relax - this was better at Old Basford than at Sherwood."
"Access to Services","I'm sad it's the last one."
"Access to Services","Would have liked a longer session, however liked flexibility of appointments"
"Access to Services","The initial screening session/first appointment was far too long after my initial referral"
"Access to Services","Took 20 weeks from initial referral from GP was not happy but was told when I rang up that this was the way the system works.  By the time I got to see my therapist for the 1st visit I was a total mess.  I did not feel the 1st session was long enough, because it took me 20 mins to calm myself enough to talk, my anxiety levels were high, i found it difficult to even attend the appt.  At the time I was almost completely housebound, my daughter accompanied me.  Over Christmas I felt suicidal, I removed all medication from my home.  I found the MIND helpline usefuil.  No one gave me the number for crisis intervention.  Now i am in remission i feel angry that the service is supposed to help and support people through difficult times with Mental Health, truly let me down.  I sincerely hope as an organisation you take on board my comments and attempt to improve what in my experience was an appalling service to help others in future.  It should not be the therapists job to apologise on the services behalf. "
"Access to Services","'The hours of the service should be extended to 6pm, because some people work & work like to use the service after 5pm."
"Access to Services","Use first assessment notes, not re-assess me 3 times before arranging care."
"Access to Services","I don't think 8 sessions is enough, should be a choice to have more if needed. "
"Access to Services","Waiting time improved.  More than 6 sessions. If possible, able to do later sessions, preferably after work."
"Communication","I had problems contacting the service during half-term.  I kept ringing and getting an answerphone.  I also had problems making the telephone appointment - can you get the diaries more in advance? Would be extremely likely to recommend this service to a friend/family."
"Access to Services","Time to get first appointment seemed a little long. Everything else was useful and appropriate to my needs."
"Access to Services","Could improve waiting times. "
"Access to Services","It would be preferable to have the opportunity to attend sessions at a alternative time e.g. evenings. Felt like a long wait for my initial assessment."
"Communication","Maybe to announce these services on the web & TV"
"Access to Services","I think that CBT should be offered much quicker to people who need help, fortunately I have a good support system around me but many people will not. Doctors need to be more positive and encourage talking therapies instead of just prescribing medication."
"Access to Services","Was concerned with how long I had to wait to be allocated a therapist. I had been told a particular number of weeks but then had to chase it up and was told to wait for I think another month. I was really desperate for support and even though an alternative number was given for support i really was disappointed with being told a particular timescale and then it not happening."
"Communication","The screening appointment could be managed better in that  I was not told where I was on the waiting list. It would be helpful if someone could have informed me that I was still on the waiting list and someone would contact me. Ay screening was informed that I would be seen right away. "
"Access to Services","Less waiting times, not being assigned to therapists that are due to leave in 2 weeks of the first session. "
"Access to Services","Longer sessions, less waiting time.  "
"Access to Services","I had to wait 5 months for my first appointment."
"Access to Services","A follow up programme as in either telephone or chat often no need for face to face back up with the knowledge that all is not finished and that there is a safety net, as in people who detox than are left alone often decline back. the knowledge of someone to just chat to, to avoid the feeling of being alone to deal with any anxiety problems that (may) occur in the future. ""Continuity of care"""
"Access to Services","There always seems to be a long waiting list when having problems with mental health if I had broken my leg or something similarI would have been seen my someone always immediately why the lack of privacy to mental patients?"
"Access to Services","After referral from my gp i had to wait many months for an appointment, this was very unhelpful considering my issues. Greater/Mover efficient administrative support would greatly benefit what turned out to be a good service , once delivered."
"Communication","Getting through on the phone is a nightmare - needs to be looked at. "
"Access to Services","Greater flexibility in booking appointment times. "
"Access to Services","Although I feel realy happy with the treatment I received and the apperoach of my therapist I feel 6 sessions is to brief."
"Access to Services","To have an in depth face to face meeting at the intial assessment say for 2 session so this would allow you to obtain the correct level of intervention you require."
"Access to Services","There are clearly resource constraints around this service as i still feel that there was much more to explore and in the private sector this would have been addressed. But this is an NHS service and I appreciate the difficulties. Overall the therapist was very good - I just think that more of it would be beneficial."
"Privacy and Dignity","I requested a female counsellor and was referred to a male CBT therapist."
"Access to Services","More sessions and different type of therapies."
"Communication","I think more information should be made available about the therapy before you embark on it via letter so you can decide if you want to go ahead with it or not."
"Access to Services","Would have liked more sessions, and preferred home visits than coming to the surgery."
"Access to Services","Reduce the waiting for an appointment time."
"Communication","I appreciate the need for monitoring most services, however I feel that the requirement to complete questionaries on a weekly basis is 'over the top' and almost invades the session."
"Access to Services","'Initally very difficult to gain access to service - very obstructive - given wrong web address - initial assessment phone call didn't occur, sat waiting at the time but no call - rang service unhelpful & unsympathetic response told that system hadn't been put in place properly & practitioner not informed. After first missed call told this wouldn't happen again - it did. Very bad intial experience of service increased anxiety levels'."
"Care/ Treatment","I am aware that this is a talking therapy but it can be easy to let it go to the back of your mind each week between sessions. Forget things that have been discussed maybe a progress chart or home work assignment each week / session to be recorded and show people the progress they have made to help with feelings of hopelessness in tough times."
"Environment/Facilities","She feels there should be comfier chairs provided in the therapy room (Community Clinic room/room 30, Sherwood Health Centre).  The room is too clinical and needs to be more comfy and less ""surgerry"". "
"Access to Services","Perhaps a quicker referral system as I found it worrying that I conveyed very strong anger in Aug last year and took several months to access any professional help. "
"Access to Services","Slightly more time at first few sessions. "
"Care/ Treatment","It would have also been good to have a physical trip out to actually see reactions."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To have interaction with others in the relationship that have to live with the day to day problems that may arise in the patient's life and give insight into how they act and respond to certain situations. "
"Access to Services","I think that being given a 6 weeks course made a time pressure for me.  To some extent although the service has been helpful there is a feeling of only having scratched the surface.  It also meant that I was very aware of the time throughout the treatment and may have put pressure on myself to 'get better' which could have been counter productive."
"Access to Services","I would have appreciated a few more sessions."
"Access to Services","Waiting times"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting list Would belikely to recommend..."
"Access to Services","Having more time. "
"Access to Services","Longer allocation than 6 sessions. "
"Access to Services","The waiting time between being adivsed to see a cbt councillor and the first appointment was about 8 months! This actually made me feel more distressed. "
"Access to Services","It would be helpful if we got more sessions if needed."
"Access to Services","I feel it's a disgrace to only be allowed 8 sessions as this amount only begins to scratch the surface of people's problems and is in no where near enough. "
"Access to Services","Unhappy with waiting times due to admin issues initially then advice to reduce drinking which Last Orders disagreed with. Sessions needed to be longer due to amount of issues. "
"Access to Services","I would have liked appointments closer to where I live because I never have bus fare so had to walk."
"Communication","Service needs to be better publiced and treatment options available more transparent lots of people need help but not aware, especially self referral."
"Access to Services","It felt like a long time to wait for the appointment. "
"Communication","Some contact during the period waiting for treatment, informing of timescale or just reassurance that the appointment was till in process, might be advisable."
"Access to Services","'I'm sad it has come to a closure at this point in time' - the client considered she would have liked a face to face follow up appointment in several months time."
"Access to Services","Annette was brilliant. It was a shame about how long i had to wait for my initial appointment and the care I recieved from the first therapist was awful. "
"Access to Services","Delays in accessing the service are very difficult to deal with and damaging to mental well being. "
"Access to Services","A shorter time between assessment and treatment. A brief meeting some 6 weeks or so after the last session to check on how you are progressing."
"Access to Services","'Better marketing of the service plus a faster response as quite a long waiting time'"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times"
"Access to Services","Shortened length of time - had to wait 7 months just for my initial assessment."
"Access to Services","'shorter waiting times as when you need counselling for an acute situation you need it strsaight away'"
"Access to Services","'The waiting time really needs to be improved'"
"Communication","Administration of the service caused several problems, appointments accidentally cancelled and other communication problems. But the service itself was fantastically helpful. "
"Communication","I felt it was a waste of time filling in the same details on the forms, week after week, this wasted talking time"
"Access to Services","Would prefer venue closer to home. Room in venue very stuffy as no windows, feels hot and stuffy Could not find venue as not well signposted"
"Access to Services","Initially was referred by GP next thing I knew I recieved a letter saying I was discharged so GP had to refer again. Seen at step 2 initially and although some of the information was helpful did not find the telephone or the email's helpful as I was too ill to look at all the stuff felt I was bombarded with too much information in a short space of time. "
"Access to Services","I had to wait some time from the screening to start of treatment, I understand that there is a waiting list. I was satisfied with the treatment but would have liked a few more sessions to complete the work that is stil required."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.  NO DIRECTION, NO FOCUS, NO EFFORT A SKIVE FOR BOTH MYSELF AND THERAPIST NOT CLEAR WHAT WAS ON OFFER. RACHEL WAS VERY NICE KIND PERSON."
"Access to Services","Needs to be more available therapy"
"Access to Services","Shorter than 4 month waiting list."
"Access to Services","Make clear about waiting times and keep patients updated. Don't keep them in the dark about whether they are being accepted for an appointment. "
"Access to Services","Should be able to get  more than 6 sessions to give full benefit."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times. The time between the telephone assessment and the face to face appointment was a number of months. It made me feelas though I had got this far; did i really need it now. The answer of course was yes. It was just the uncomfortable feeling of waiting so long between appointments. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I had to see about three different people before I got my sessions, which I thought was a waste of time."
"Access to Services","Happy with the overall treatment but would have liked to have more sessions to finish and cement some of the work done. There is a pressure to do the work within the sessions allocated and sometimes  I have worried that I have only so many sessions to complete the work."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The Service needs more IPT Therapists Extremely likely to recommend to family/friends"
"Access to Services","Although I was satisfied with the treatment I felt overall that the treatment was not long enough which I understand is a service issue."
"Access to Services","Doing something to reduce the waiting time from referral to first appointment.   I really struggled and with no support system outside from friends and family this was exasperated.  However Rick Cassell was brilliant !  I could not have asked for a better person to help."
"Access to Services","It has been very difficult to fill this in. While i was doing the therapy, i was very well and positive but I am now struggling with anxiety and less confident that I can use the techniques effectively. I have been struggling for three weeks and I feel as if I have returned to how I was when I started therapy."
"Access to Services","Time scale between 1st interview and therapy was too long - this could be improved. Therapy itself was fantastic and has helped me very much. "
"Access to Services","'I would only suggest that the contact from initial meeting in regards to treatment would be quicker, however I was informed about the wait. Overall good service I feel a lot better about myself."
"Access to Services","Less of a waiting time. The initial assessment is a long winded process which isn't the most reassuring for anxiety. The call centre type experience is something I found quite disconcerting and would prefer to actually see a person. Clearer explanation of the process at initial GP referral.  Yes I would recommend this service to a family member of friend. "
"Access to Services","Waited several months for 1st appointment, then was told that someone tried to contact me by phone but never left a messagge so i didn't know and then was put back on the waiting list again for few months. I was initially told I would be referred to CBT but in fact was sent on a course of step 2 work which was of no benefit to me, I only discovered part way through step2 that it wasnt in fact cbt and that I would need to go on hte waiting list to be referred to cbt .  "
"Care/ Treatment","""V slighly longer appointments(full hour where possible)"""
"Access to Services","More people so people don'y have to wait. Having CBT closer to where I live."
"Access to Services","I disagree with the sessions being limited to 8; I found it was a deterrant to the progression of my therapy as I felt that the therapist and myself had to complete treatment within a limited timeframe."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The only thing I thought would have made recommendation on how to alleviate some of the problems. Talking to her she said the puprose is not for to her to make assessment."
"Access to Services","Therapy was useful however I would have found a follow up session after a 2-3 month interval would have been helpful"
"Environment/Facilities","Window in therapy room would be helpful- claustrophobic feeling in the room Having the venue at GP surgery would be better location as NCS not easily accessed-map supplied by LTW needs updated as it is not clear which street NCS is on Telephone assessment could have been more thorough and supplimented with written information regarding different types of therapy available Computer site could be a problem for those with limited educational skills"
"Access to Services","The waiting list was far to long for me."
"Access to Services","Waiting time for treatment"
"Access to Services","1. Reduction in waiting time, whilst I appreciate the NHS's  (cannot make out the word) waiting time should be much shorter.  (although there might be a recommended time for urgent treatment I'm not aware of)."
"Access to Services","Had to wait three months before I was seen which was the only downside. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time and more sessions available if necessary.   "
"Involvement","At my initial appointment (before receiving counselling) I was not given any options for treatment and was told that the service was in a state of flux and there was uncertainty about who would deliver the treatment and where it would take place."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","'I would like more time because of my speech'"
"Communication","Often got reminder text messages for my appointments after the appointment time.  This was confusing as I once thought that my appointment had been cancelled and missed one as my confirmation didnt come through until 10.00  am (my appointment was @ 8.45 am). Also as someone allocated any early appointment (before 9.00 am) I had an occasion where I couldnt make it as I was poorly - but was unable to contact the service to notify my therapist in time. Lastly the staff @ St Anns Health Centre, although very helpful and friendly had no idea what was happening with my appointments and could offer no help or advice. "
"Access to Services","More funding for counselling possible bhy taking funding from GPS handing out pills instead of addressing issues. Better GP knowlege of mental health issues. The client said question 9 was no applicable and question 8 non taken. The client also said at question 4 if i was prepared to wait longer"
"Access to Services","The only problem was waiting time sometimes I could be sat waiting for 45 mins in waiting room however this was rarely an issue and i just brought work to read."
"Access to Services","I was told at initial assessment that I would be referred for client centered counselling but was actually referred for CBT which took a lot londer than anticipated to come through. I was told non CBT would be quicker."
"Access to Services","I found it very difficult to access the service at a time I needed help and waited to long.  I have found working with Elaine an incredabilty helpful experience, she has helped me to appreciate that I have skills to manage my depression. I have felt safe with her and able to be completely honest, thankyou Elaine."
"Care/ Treatment","Appointments after 5pm so they didn't interfere with work."
"Access to Services","I had no problems withmy therapists themselves, who were courteious and fully professional, only the therapy 25/30 minutes is a pointless amount of time to get any subject approached with the discussion required, let alone perform any physical tasks. I also do not think ticking 1-10 scales is an acurate depiciton of living with depression. I understand how busy your therapists are so i am not blaming them or your organisation but i never felt like the surface got scrathched on any of the main issues that required me to seek therapy in the first place. Thanks to all the indivuals who worked with me, I am most greatful especially to the therapist who spent time with me."
"Communication","Decided to end treatment in session. No paper copy. Asking clients these questions verbally may lead to a bias in results. It may be appear confrontational to ask clients feedback if they have been unhappy with therapy.  Consider an alternative system for collecting this data, such as using stamped addressed envelope."
"Access to Services","I think there should be more time to explore more aves as there is sort time to try and get every ave told about oneself"
"Communication","After the GP referral the corrospondence I recieved was confusing as it had the wrong name on it therefore I had to chase up and ring the service and was advised to fill in a self referal form. I was told I would have been seen within 6 weeks, I had the telephone assessment but had to wait a while beore being seen for therapy."
"Access to Services","It would help if the client & therapist can reach the conclusion that the therapy can last longer than 6 sessions may be 8 ?"
"Environment/Facilities","Stress Aids- Such as a stress ball for someone to use during session."
"Access to Services","I wait to wait approx 5 months  for my first appoinmnet ( not including the pre-assessment).  I feel that I have just started making progress and would benefit from further sessions - I feel I have been offered half a service !"
"Access to Services","The clients feedback to the following questions: 1.- 12-16 weeks wait from diagnosis is not good but is no doubt due to lack of resources. 6 but i did not need such information. 11- As stated in question 2 the delay between being diagnoised and receiving counselling was ludicrous. By the time the appointmetn with the counsellor arrived it was almost five months from diagnosis. Clearly there is insufficient supply to meet the demand. The treatment was however very useful and did help me to recover."
"Access to Services","Extend duration of therapy."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time, more appointments. Thank you for everything!"
"Access to Services","More apts to continue to assist in finding ways to address the problems affecting me.  "
"Access to Services","Feedback about my request for extra help after the initial group session was not passed on which meant I had to wait longer-this could be improved. "
"Access to Services","long waiting time. "
"Access to Services","Too long a wait."
"Communication","I feel like the information that was given last year was no even touched upon, the books focused on the present.  I thought I was going to have more than books during therapy. I really feel due to past events not present that I would benefit from cognitive behavioural therapy hense, ( I thought) the long waiting time for the service. My therapist was fantastic for the here and now events that we discussed but I feel slightly lost still."
"Access to Services","When on a waiting list there should be someone to talk to over the phone as i feel medication could have been dayled for me if this was an option."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I think it would be helpful to have support while waiting on the waiting list and a follow up after therapy"
"Care/ Treatment","More in depth therapy sessions. "
"Access to Services","More options during assessment period of treatment for types of treatment that would suit. Less waiting time. Peer support."
"Access to Services","More sessions. Tools/tips/exercises to change way of thinking."
"Access to Services","Perhaps consider a future where 3-6 monthly visits are done with patients to see how they are coping or have improved."
"Access to Services","Feel like I would have benefitted from a longer period of therapy- didn't like the fact that there was a time limit. Feel a bit 'wobbly' about not coming to see the therapist anymore."
"Access to Services","Have more sessions.  To continue to run this service"
"Communication","I would suggest making sure you listen to all the information the client is giving around preferences. At the start of the process I had to wait many months because key preferences were not noted. Staff didn't get back to me when they said they would. Quite a sad circumstance it prolonged the sense of isolation."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Perhaps more advice on how to address issues as they arise."
"Communication","Would recommend to others. Feels that carers need to be made more aware of what is available to them (through LTW) Room (White room in NCVS basement) is small claustrophobic and officey "
"Access to Services","Just the waiting time."
"Access to Services","The only improvement that I can suggest to improve the psychological therapies service is to focus on shortening the time taken to get from my referral to my first appointment. However given the quality of the treatment I received from my therapist ( Asmita Sakaria) it was worth the wait! I would like to pass on my gratitude to Asmita for the excellent skills she used to help me improve my condition."
"Communication","More information before starting the treatment, re what is likely to happen, how it works etc. I had no idea what the CBT session were how it worked and to mangage expectations and that there isnt a magic formula. I felt the inital waiting time was too long eg after my initail assessment it was severeal weeks and i went from feeling some relief with help being available to feeling quite desperate even an update on where you are in the system would be good."
"Access to Services","I feel that due to service constraints the therapy  stopped just as it was starting."
"Access to Services","You have to give more time for the first assesment. If the first therapist had listened to me well, then this would have avoided me seeing 3 people for CBT before starting counselling."
"Access to Services","Make first appointments quicker."
"Access to Services","Would have preferred to start therapy earlier. I think it was about 4 months from when I first went to the doctor. A bit more time in sessions, sometimes cut short. "
"Access to Services","The waiting time for the first appointment is a bit too long and I dont really understand the limit of the 6 sessions.  But everything else was very good.  Thank you."
"Care/ Treatment","Unfortunatley due to time constraints we were not able to have enough appointments."
"Access to Services","My feelings are that the sessions were helpful but I would have liked to have more. Also I feel that these sessions have acted as a safety net and I now feel slight panic that they have finished    written by jan Nowakowska Interpreter"
"Access to Services","The treatment can be longer. "
"Environment/Facilities","Because of the deep sitted feelings that where confirmedI felt vunerable and tearful, when having the session I would have preferred a private entrance out of the building to help my embaressment."
"Communication","Make it easier for patients to contact the service by phone or other forms of technology. 'Let's Talk App'. "
"Access to Services","I was happy with the service in general. However, Kara was late (up to 20 minutes) for the majority of our apoinments. It wasnt that she had ranover, but that as she admitted herself, she hasnt allowed  enough travelling time. As anxiety is one of my symptoms i found this quite stressful. Sessions frequently overran the hour and made me late for appointments with other services in cornerstone. I had to keep track of the time mysefl for this readon. This nearly putting me off continuing."
"Access to Services","Wish I could have had longer"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The initial screening left me feeling like I didn't matter - it felt rushed and I had little confidence in the screener"
"Access to Services","More sessions - 6 not enough!"
"Access to Services","Could do with more sessions that 6."
"MHA","Less reliance on quantitative methods of gathering data about the patients mood etc - eg PHQ-9 and GAD-7. They are non-contextual and the questions are not relevant in some cases. They are worded badly and should not be used as a measure of recovery. "
"Access to Services","Would have benefitted from this treatment a lot more had I been able to have it when I really needed it.  The waiting time was so long that I had to effectively treat myself, which wouldn't necessarily work for others and could be potentially very harmful."
"Access to Services","I would have appreciated the opportunity to have more sessions with my therapist, it was explained to me but previously I could have 16 sessions."
"Communication","1. More information in the public domain e.g I did not know that I could have self referred which would have gained me quicker treatment, as going to the doctor to admit my problems was hard and took a long time. 2. Quicker start date my assessment was quick after my referral: then it was a 4 month wait - worth it though.! "
"Access to Services","Waiting list improvement"
"Communication","not filled out as takes to long, clients 1st language is not English.  Took 35 minutes to fill out psy measures"
"Access to Services","Can be best if offered more sessions. "
"Access to Services","Getting seen quicker"
"Access to Services","Probably the time it takes to get an appointment- but it was also good to receive a phone call to say it wouldn't take much longer to get an appointment. Then I knew where I was on the waiting list."
"Communication","To discuss things deeply and to be told what to expect and then decide if I want to go through with it."
"Access to Services","'I would liked to have longer time with Elaine as she really understood me & helped me'"
"Access to Services","The only downfall was the length of time waiting for an appointment. Which took several months."
"Access to Services","It took an extremely long time to get my first appointment. Almost 6 months from the day of my assessment. "
"Access to Services","It is likely that I would recommend the service. Waiting times too long. 12 weeks not long enough. "
"Communication","'Being able to get through on the telephones or able to have a voice mail service'"
"Access to Services","Maybe to improves access more efficiently and less assessment would be required prior to worker allocation. Or if necessary, to have the assessments completed by one person."
"Access to Services","The only thing that could be improved was the long wait after GP referral and ringing to chase it after a couple of months."
"Access to Services","I wouldnt change anything about the treatment but the wiating time from first assessment to my first session seemed like an age when i felt like i was crying out for help. That said once the sessiomn came i felt they were very helpful"
"Access to Services","Keep it going!"
"Access to Services","Took quite a while for my initial contact to my 1st appointment. I wasn't given options of therapy but had asked for CBT sessions anyway. I was offered a choice of male or female, was offered several different venue options. More time with therapist. "
"Access to Services","Had to initially wait 5 months to start therapy which I feel was far too long a wait and is something you should try and improve. Annette has been fantastic in my sessions and I am very pleased with how we have worked together. I have felt able to open up fully and have seen a huge improvement in myself and my wellbeing. Overall i am very pleased with the service you provide"
"Access to Services","Would have liked longer."
"Access to Services","The wait for IAPT was too long without any contact from the service. Luckily, I had regular contact from my GP in between time. "
"Access to Services","Very satisfied with Rory. Very dis-satisfied in the time it took to see him. Phoning your office in the first instance, very dis-satisfied. I feel much happier and this has worked for me!!!"
"Access to Services","It took me a while for me to trust the therapist because of what I've been through which ate into the limited sessions offered by the service. I strongly believe that the decision as to how many sessions are needed should be the sole decision of the therapist as they are the person that see me  and knows my limitations."
"Communication","Better phone contact perhaps more sessions"
"Access to Services","Shorter wait time for first appointment"
"Access to Services","Possibly to make the service a little longer as I felt 10 weeks was a bit rushed, but apart from that I felt the service on the whole was fine."
"Access to Services","The waiting time was too long and I beleive you should leave therapy when you are ready not because you have ran out of time slots.  The client also responded to question 9 with the following ""however i didnt need to""."
"Access to Services","I would have liked sessions to have continued for more than 6 weeks."
"Access to Services","Waiting times for first appointment too long, could offer alternative help in the waiting time. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times"
"Access to Services","Patient has requested to continue treatment."
"Access to Services","More sessions would have been nice even though I understand why there wasn't"
"Access to Services","Longer session period."
"Access to Services","I had to wait 6 months for treatment. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Had to see 3 people before I found someone who understood and helped. Had lots of issues but no one seems to be able to seperate them and work out what to do."
"Access to Services","Rick was excellent and has really helped.  However, there were delays due to issues at your office that did delay treatment and added to the loss of my job.  Issues at your office - messages not passed on, lost return forms after Stress Workshop, removal from waiting list."
"Access to Services","Monkia is dissatisfied with the service due to having waited 4 months for treatment. She would kie to say that we did not give her help when she needed it. Monika was happy with todays session with me and polish interpretor and thanked us."
"Access to Services","Waiting time 4 1/2 months on waiting list - Location is awkward to get to without a car. "
"Access to Services","'Possibly to have more than six sessions'"
"Access to Services","Appointments made available outside of 9-5 hours."
"Access to Services","Service been good, wish I could have more sessions."
"Environment/Facilities","Hopeing the service will be highly successful (no doubt im sure) or possibly with lottery funding. i think it would be an assset to have your own clinic, not a health centre, when your feeling low and vunerable you dont want to be in the company of drug users and alchoholics(no disrespect to those people) a more private clinic would (im sure) be more practical. (my opinion)."
"Communication","Improved communication which did improve as time proceeded."
"Access to Services","Would have liked longer sessions, takes times to build relationships just got to know and feel comfortable."
"Environment/Facilities","Didn't like room too claustrophobic but okay with therapy."
"Access to Services","I waited 10 months before getting therapy following initial assessment and within that period mental stability was greatly impacted on therefore by the time I saw someone things had deteriorated hugely had I got the treatment earlier this may have been prevented. "
"Access to Services","Not limiting session quantities. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Face to face discussion would have been more helpful."
"Access to Services","I had to wait a long time from initially seeing my dotor to my first assessment."
"Access to Services","Being seen more quickly (although I understand that would be difficult). By the time I started CBT my situation had changed slightly and so I didn't feel the initial assessment was entirely relevent anymore. "
"Access to Services","I'd think if the service gave all GP's had the number for Let's Talk so the patient can phone so don't have to wait longer to be referred like my GP gave me the number which I think helped."
"Environment/Facilities","'Type of room setting & offer of water'"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would prefer face to face."
"Access to Services","Longer periods of time for therapy than 6 weeks or 6 one hour sessions"
"Access to Services","Had been before so carried on from that.  shorter waiting time. "
"Access to Services","I had to wait four months after the initial phone assessment which I felt was too long without further contact; especially as my issue was worry."
"Access to Services","Waiting lists please. More funding! "
"Access to Services","Maybe longer sessions ie having more sessions"
"Access to Services","Availability of more sessions/longer term therapy Would be likely to recommend this service to family member or friend"
"Care/ Treatment","I was offered different variations on CBT, and although this has helped, it would have been good to have been offered actual counselling to get to the root of the problem as this fits me better."
"Access to Services","The service and the therapy/therapist has been excellent. However, I would have liked a quicker response from the time of making the initial contact via phone to starting the actual therapy. When I called at the start, that is when I felt the worst and low and needed the help the most but I had to wait over a week for the initial call with a therapist then be on a waiting list to start therapy."
"Access to Services","Needed longer"
"Access to Services","I do not think that 8 sessions is enough."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times"
"Access to Services","They ought to fund you better."
"Access to Services","If this service could be offered by GP at an earlier stage as it's very beneficial and patients would benefit.  For example, I didn't know this service was available and I believe I could have had it earlier as it's a good tool to use."
"Access to Services","I could not get through on the telephone number when I needed to change an appointment. I had to resort to email. There should be an answer phone facility or a different number to ring"
"Communication","I rang when I was ill to let the service know I wouldn't be able to attend, this message was not passed on to my therapist. My sessions were nearly cancelled as a result."
"Access to Services","The waiting time after the assessment to be quicker."
"Access to Services","I would recommend the service. The only problem I had with the service was the length of time i had to wait before seeing a therapist. I just wanted to add how much seeing Maria Parker has helped. Her professionalism and compassion is a credit to the service."
"Access to Services","Preferred shorter waiting time. I have really got something out of my time here - improved self esteem and confidence by using different strategies offered to me.  It is extremely likely that I would recommend service to friends and family"
"Access to Services","Preferred a shorter waiting time to be seen. "
"Access to Services","Some sort of follow up after the 6 sessions had finished.  Spacing out the sessions more would have been more beneficial to me e.g one session per month rather than weekly.  other alternatives to help in the future like CBT."
"Access to Services","Wait for treatment was too long. Therapist was very helpful"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","After changing so many therapists in your service I finally found one that I can work with but now she has to move to another area, I am not happy with that."
"Access to Services"," Time scale for 1st appointment was far too long"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It has been good to have someone to talk to.  Too much time spent doing paperwork. Not enough time trying to help put things right. It has taken a lot for me to remember things of hurt that was put to the back of my mind with no outcome of the time of ""16 meetings"" on the plus side I have lost 1st 4lbs. Had to do report every week (why every week) I sent a report in to you week 4, I think it would have been better the last week. "
"Care/ Treatment","Probably just a bit longer per session. Otherwise I found it very flexible & helpful to my needs."
"Communication","Pherhaps alittle more information about what to expect - very difficult to comprehend when feeling stressed and have difficulty in retaining/understanding new information.  Although the service has been brilliant for me & helped me so much !! Thank You !!."
"Access to Services","Reduction in waiting time. NHS special material, rather than borrow from internet."
"Access to Services","The therapist who worked with me, was a tremendous help to me, and my situation. Wish the sessions were longer over more wecks"
"Access to Services","Dont tell patients that the treatment usually lasts 6 sessions I felt anxious that I needed more time & self conscious too"
"Care/ Treatment","Would have welcomed group sharing. Others'coping strategies have been invaluable"
"Access to Services","More sessions are needed"
"Access to Services","Possibility greater availability and faster initial appointment"
"Access to Services","Long wait was at the time of service change over"
"Communication","Keep patients informed about waiting list"
"Access to Services","Took a long time from referral 16th July 09 to see someone, assessment May 2010 & counselling started Sept 2010"
"Access to Services","My only criticism is it took around 7 months to receive my appointment due to the service changing."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting list"
"Access to Services","Would have liked more than six sessions."
"Access to Services","I found the ten months I had to wait for my first appointment very, very hard.  I had a 45 minute telephone assessment 5 months after my GP referral.  The therapist I spoke to decided that I definately nedded individual therapy.  It was another five months before I got this first appointment, and only then after 2 letters from my GP. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff to help - this will bring the waiting list down"
"Access to Services","Felt as though you (the service) had forgotten me at first. Would havve appreciate postcard or something to let me knnow I was still on waiting list.  Q.12: Extremely likely to recommend service to friend or family memberer"
"Access to Services","I would prefer a longevity of the coruse past 6 weeks. also a coffee machine! =) liz blatherwick has been a super counsellor, thanks."
"Access to Services","Time pressured due to 50 min sessions, would have been helpful if it had an hour.  very helpful to know I can re refer in future working with Veronica has been like talking with a friend who has skills "
"Access to Services","The length of treatment being too short, e.g. number of session."
"Care/ Treatment","Very useful thank you one practical suggestion is to have the sessions a bit later as 5:30 was a bit tricky to get to  on time from work."
"Access to Services","Although this service has been of great help to me, it came far too late as I had to wait 5 months for an appiontment. This just made my whole situation even worse as even after intervetion by my gp i still did not get an appiontment when I nededed one most, Also I am very disapionted that sessions are capped & can only be extended if I go back to my gp & re-apply. I feel I have reached a piont in my therapy sessions where I could carry on as I am fully engaged in my treatment but unfortunatley this is not an optoin & I am now worried about leaving the sessions when I shouldn't as I don't feel completly better."
"Access to Services","I had to wait approx 8 months for my first appointment and during this time enquiry e-mails went unanswered. Once this problem was resolved I was very pleased indeed by the quality of the service."
"Access to Services","Have waited 2 years for treatment prior to this treatment offered very good with CPN."
"Access to Services","Earlier information about how to get relaxation MP35.  I tried a couple of bizarre ones available on the web before I came across MIND and similar resourses"
"Access to Services","For my first therpay (talking)I would have probably appreciated more than just 6 sessions"
"Involvement","Didn't really want or need this- came along because doctor advised me to- re atos assessment"
"Access to Services","Sessions a month or two after the final session to check in."
"Care/ Treatment","I often thought therapists wanted to keep my anxiety more black and white than it possibly is, although I appreciate that they did try to deal with both my Social Anxiety and Post Traumatic Stress."
"Access to Services","Not needing to finish the course and their re-refer back into the same therapy"
"Access to Services","I would have liked further sessions as I had built up a relationship with Ruth where I felt Ruth knew a lot about me and I could then make progress. I'm a little upset that I may need to go through this all with another therapist in the future."
"Access to Services","The time could be reduced for the first appointment."
"Access to Services","I understand cuts have been made in Mental Haelth so apprecicate waiting times can be lengthy, however in moments of desperation even a week can feel like a lifetime"
"Communication","The only problem I came across with the service was that the email address was wrong on all paperwork and telephone number I was given was constantly engaged or not answered  But Margo was brilliant and very helpfull"
"Access to Services","You need to provide the service at any stage in the crisis."
"Access to Services","More sessions needed as by my 6th session the CBT was just starting to help me"
"Access to Services","My therapist (Linda White) was excellent in helping me understand the causes of my anxiety and as mechanisms for changing my outlook and unfortunately the spell of support has been too short as I am still suffering with spells of anxiety and Linda brought to my attention the leaflet Mindfulness Cognitive based therapy for Depression.  I have contact you to express a strong desire to participate in the programme.  I believe Linda will be recommending this.  (I am actively involved in reading and learning of this approach and would greatly appreciate assistance in mentoring and support as I am still struggling to achieve balanced judgements and to deal with reality by achieving a being state I need help to develop ways to realx to ease my stress Please help me."
"Access to Services","I had to wait 10 months for my first appointment and had no contact during this time from the service to say I was still waiting.  So perhaps a call to the client awaiting the service would be appropriate to ensure they are still on waiting list.  It is first to long to wait."
"Access to Services","Was initially offered CBT, on discussion was agreed counselling was needed, was a long wait to be offered but very satisfied with therapist and feel better in myself for this being offered"
"Access to Services","Some changes to date for first appointment but waiting time was ok.  Long gap til 2nd appointment (May-October.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Although I appreciate the help, I do not think the style of the course at the library suited my needs.  I am looking forward to the one to one with Age Concern in September.  The course was too intense and was more about teaching or lecturing about the subject but it did not help me at all feel any better.  I understand why I feel this way and what I should do in the future."
"Access to Services","Very dissatisfied with the length of time it took to get an initial appointment.  "
"Access to Services","Attended stress management course to accompany my wife (initially). Found the course excellent, but still feel I need the CBT that I am waiting for (since may 2010). Only suggestion - therapists to slow down a little, sometimes I feel rushed when reading the powerpoint and taking it in."
"Access to Services","I had to wait months and months before receiving any contact from anyone. I found the initial assessment difficult as I had to talk on very difficult subjects then was left with no support for several more months. By the time I had my first appointment 121 I was due to give birth and was not pregnant when first referred. 121 was good but 2 sessions then the therapist moved out of the area. So no helpful work done due to lack of time. "
"Access to Services","My appointments came the week before I was due to commence 1st course option so due to work commitments I had to cancel 1st course option. 2nd option came day before course was due to start and my manager and I had to change my shifts, this is very distressing before I commence.   "
"Access to Services","a shorter waiting list for the first appointment"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not keen on this distant/telephone therapy treatment but I guess it worked in the end.  Raki, my therapist was good and professional all the way through my treatment.  I think face to face would have been better for me."
"Involvement","A joint decision when to stop sessions"
"Care/ Treatment","A decision made by a therapist who assessed me was overturned by someone who only saw the psychological measure. This resulted in a delay in me being seen and receiving help. I think most weight should be given to the decision of the person who has actually seen the service user face to face."
"Communication","To be given literature on all available options and then given time to decide which might be best.  It can be difficult to realise why you may have low mood/depression"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times and various choices given at the initial meeting.  Once the case was picked up by another case worker (Natalie) they were very helpful and not at all negative (the sessions).  *At the initial meeting I was given a list of books to read, due to my depression and other circumstances, this was the last thing I needed as concentration was very low at that time"
"Access to Services","I was happy with the therapist, I however feel dissatified with the amount of time with the therapist.  Four visits is not enough and I had to begun to trust and form a good professional relationship with my therapist and feel this has been cut short."
"Communication","Sorting out the phone answering service. Trying to pass messages like ""I will be late, stuck in traffic"" or ""I cant make it today, my friend passed away""  to my therapist  has proven very difficult & time consuming. "
"Access to Services","I realised that this stress control course was not really going to really help me after week 1. It would appear that you have to go through the whole course before something else is offerd to you. It's 3 months since i self-referred via my doctor and i am still needing the type of help that i think i need.. the telephone assessment on 5th march - I am surprised that this course was thought to resolve my complex issues"
"Communication","I was expecting to receive counselling so was surprised to find it wasn't when I got to see the therapist.  I was sent a letter for groups in Mansfield by mistake. The wording of the letter was not friendly.  It's a shame that the budget does not allow you to give out copies of the overcoming depression and low mood (Williams) as a workbook for clients. I felt pleased that it was easy to attend evening sessions and that they were local."
"Access to Services","A review after completing the therapy may be good after 3 months."
"Access to Services","I was extremly satisfied with the treatment I received, however it took a very long time to get my assessment booked and once I received the appointment details I was sent to the wrong place. "
"Access to Services","It would be better if patients didn't have to wait so long after the initial assessment - My Doctor eventually had to chase it up. "
"Access to Services","Be able to have more appointments without having to wait."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More therapists would be good to reduce the waiting list. "
"Care/ Treatment","Knowing in advance the duration of the appointment and if it is going to be reduced because of particular circumstances: then possibly have the opportunity to re-arrange for another full appointment or divide the time over 2 sessional appointments either phone and in person. The key aspect is allowing the time to be given appropriately for the client."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Homework - personal tasks kept for the next session focussed on me Sheets (measures) - interesting completing realising how numerically I'd change myself"
"Access to Services","I asked for help with depression following multiple bereavements, and long term Counselling.  Only short term Counselling was offered and was insufficient for my particular difficulties.  No  long term Counselling was available to me on the National Health so I was directed to fee paying services of which I was already aware.  I feel let down as I could have worked with my Counsellor.  May self-refer later."
"Access to Services","I would like to have had an option to carry on with more sessions."
"Involvement","This particular counselling was useful. However previous I thought I was going for counselling and was sent to CBT which I didn't know until I got there and it was completely unsuitable for my problems. I think this should have been made clear at the start. I also had a problem with the CBT therapist who offended me and I do not think my complaint was handled correctly. It was basically brushed off and still no apology."
"Access to Services","Reduce time between differing treatments. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have preferred to have all my therapy face to face as I dont find phone calls satisfactory.  I probably sounded better than I was on the phone.  Due to my being away sometimes and the limited hours available with my therapist it was some time - 3 weeks - between contacts and I could not remember when asked for numbers as how I had been, so closer together contact times may have been better for me."
"Access to Services","More sessions!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More therapists and would prefer a longer period of treatment.  Also a follow up appointment after a mutually agreed period after treatment to see how ""one gets on"". Then a report back/further assessment and offer, if necessary, further different treatment options.  Also there is still too much reliance on a quick fix, drugs (eg prozac) bases solution too many times."
"Access to Services","1. First Appointment - took 6 months to get referred 2.  Routine Psychological Measures - needs revising - ambiguous  Quality of my therapist Nicholas Serieyes was exceptional - transformed my life"
"Communication","I seemed to do most of the talking.  I was expecting to receive more input and advice and further guidance."
"Care/ Treatment","Limited use of online CBT - I had this before and feel this face to face CBT was much more beneficial.  The online CBT is perhaps more helpful in terms of depressive symptoms."
"Communication","Presentation bu Bert was good, however, a lot of the time is spent on what symptoms you may have (but dont) rather than appropriate action to address ""stress"" regardless of which of many of potential symptoms you may suffer from.  Presentation by female speaker was distracting due to presentation (lack of) technique."
"Access to Services","Waiting for appointment was long used mood gym on Doctors advice to use in that time."
"Communication","The questionaire is confusing (phobia and wasa)  I would recommend this service/ Margo to fam and friends"
"Access to Services","I understand that the demand is high for these services, however, the wait was very long.  At the time, I was desperate for some help, and ended up attempting to take my life, as I felt there wasn't the help and support I needed.  "
"Access to Services","The 6 sessions are not enough.  There is not enough time to start to get answers.  12 sessions may be a better number.  The initial assessment needs ti improve as the lady that saw me felt I was in for the wrong treatment.  I have 40 years+ of low self esteem and personal bullying that I dont feel will every be helped.  I have learnt and understand this and I now have better tips to cope."
"Access to Services","Being seen sooner, reduce the waiting time"
"Access to Services","A shorter time waiting. I would recommend this service to a family member or friend."
"Care/ Treatment","More opportunities for appointments outside working hours"
"Access to Services","Not enough sessions allowed on NHS to feel that I had made progress enough to give me confidence to continue.  Felt a bit cut-off at the time when trust had been built and more difficult issues had been toughced upon but not explored.  Its good that can re-refer after 3 months. Other than that I am very grateful for the help that has been provided and the way it was done."
"Access to Services","More sessions with Vanda"
"Access to Services","The amount of time taken to get help following being put down for ""emergency"" therapy was rediculous. Whilst I appreciate that money and resources are a problem, in other situations than mine (as it happens) have been okay. It might be very well be the last straw for someone in extremis. Also having at last started, my therapist had to skip several weeks, due to other claims of his time."
"Environment/Facilities","The only thing that bothered me was when I broke a bone in my foot.  I had to cancel my sessions and found it hard to contact somebody to cancel my appointments.  I had to go down to the Health Centre my self."
"Care/ Treatment","Have more options of treatment to choose Have the choice of therapist Have more time in each session to talk to the therapist 50 mins not long enough. Have all information sent to us in relation to the treatments before going head with treatment sent the the post."
"Access to Services","Terrible waitng times initially"
"Access to Services","Just the wait time - took six months for the first CBT appointment which is a very long time to wait when feeling depressed"
"Access to Services","wider range of hours available for those who cannot take time off work - although I understand this is not always possible. I have periodic depression/anxiety and by waiting 6-7 months for an appointment I was feeling less bad by the time I got help."
"Access to Services","Reduce the 3 month waiting time"
"Access to Services","Initial timescales felt like a long time - but I understand that this this is to be expected within the current climate"
"Access to Services","Just the waiting time "
"Access to Services","A slightly shorter waiting list would be good but other than thaat I thought it was an excellent service.  My therapist was extremely good and evin in the short amount of sessions it mostly cured my general anxiety disorder, as well as causeing a huge improvement in my social anxiety which I have suffered with for years."
"Access to Services","Could do with more time. unlikely to recommend the course"
"Access to Services","Helpful to start doing something rather than just thinking about it, keen to use the mindfulness therapy in the future."
"Access to Services","The treatment has been very helpful. However I think the wait time was too long. If I haven't had friends & Family to support me in the meantime, the situation could have gotten much worse."
"Communication","I would like information - distilled of course provided on the course to be made available at GPs in the for of say A4 information sheets dealing with stress and anxiety. This would dispel some of the fears when they arise"
"Access to Services","To be able to have more sessions."
"Access to Services","Waiting to long for treatment."
"Access to Services","I would try to improve waiting timesas had to wait 3-4 months."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I really enjoyed talking with Charlotte, it has made a big difference, and if I was to refer myself I would like Charlotte again."
"Communication","Maybe suggest to other patients new to this service, that they may well, at first, think that this isn't working/beneficial for them, especially after the first session. Urge them to persevere. It's definately worth continuing."
"Access to Services","The only fauly I've found is the waiting period for the first appointment.  If I'd not been as strong minded and suffered suicidal thoughts I may not have made it to the first appointment.  "
"Environment/Facilities","Therapy room was at times smelly (unidentified smell) From the self referral the process was very quick to getting appointments for treatment.  Amazing how such little changes can make such a difference"
"Access to Services","To be seen more quickly."
"Access to Services","Q.12: yes would recommed service More prompt assessment and commencing therapy at the beginning when I was at my lowest ebb."
"Environment/Facilities","Quieter venue needed. Difficult to focus and concentrate"
"Communication","Initial screening, didn't know enough about the types of therapies that were on offer."
"Access to Services","More sessions per client would be helpfull over a longer time scale"
"Access to Services","The wait for the first appointment was too long."
"Access to Services","Would recomend that this type of treatment be offered early allowing diagnosis. I wish I had been offered this treatment earlier."
"Access to Services","Perhaps if people did not wait so long for therapy and I do understand. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I thought I was having a 1 to 1 talking too.  A bit more personal.  But I understand there is more than me to try and talk to."
"Communication","MODULES WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR ME TO TAKE AWAY AFTER MY FIRST APPOINTMENT - I HAD TO WAIT FOR THEM TO BE POSTED OUT.  I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO TAKE THEM AWAY."
"Access to Services","""Need some more counsellors so waiting times isn't too long. Saw GP 16/2/11 - first appointment 10/6 so it seemed like a long wait. I phoned to check and was told I may have to wait another 3 months. This increased my very high levels of anxiety. Worth the wait in the end""."
"Access to Services","Waiting list too long"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Longer time in meetings"
"Access to Services","In my view it could last longer and be more flexible."
"Communication","Communication could have been better. Follow-up appointments much slower than suggested at initial assessment and I had to do the chasing to find out what was happening and got very little other than ""on waiting list"" - Then just one weeks notice of course starting! You are dealing with people with stress/anxiety/low mood - uncertainty about what is happening and when does not help. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have prferred a face to face appointment rather that over the telephone. I did state this in our initial meeting and a couple times later to no effect. I found I had to join a quiet space in a public area which was less than ideal. I do not know why a face to face meeting was a problem but feel it would improve things if a person knew they definitley could do this if they wanted."
"Access to Services","Possibly a bit longer between sessions in order to give more time to do repeatable tasks."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Further support wanted"
"Communication","While I was waiting for therapy I was sent a pack of information and self-help for anxiety in the post. It was a lot of paperwork and print outs with no clear steps on how to use it. In the confusing state of mind I was in at the time, I think it would be more beneficial if you were to send clear information on accredited websites. I think this would help vulnerable people avoid websites made by opportunists etc. On a personal note, I would strongly recommend the website anxietynomore.co.uk as a recovery tool. It was created by a man who suffered for years and gives a good insight into the physical problems taking place that in fluence how you feel. It does have a recommendation for his book but most of the information that has had a profound effect on my recovery has come from the site itself. I think the waiting list is too long however I understand how this cannot be helped given the financial state of things Other than this I think the content of therapy was very interesting and delivered in a laid back way which was conducive to recovering from anxiety."
"Access to Services","A recall session within 12 months (Info for self refferal now received)"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","However convenient it may be for either party to wish to participate in a telephone consultation, nothing beats a face to face meeting."
"Access to Services","I realise resources are scarce but I would have liked to be seen sooner.. I accept the service did what it could to have me seen as soon as possible. I would ask that the service is given more resource so patients can be seen sooner as per clinical need. "
"Environment/Facilities","Having a dedicated place for cunsultations rather than renting rooms."
"Care/ Treatment","I would prefer options because I go CBT which I have completed previously before plus I spent 5 sessions doing CBT again and nothing changed or improved."
"Access to Services","I don't know what would improve the service in my case I felt it was in my early 20's and there is too much to go through, 12 1hr sessions don't work when there is a life time of anxiety, which is clinical. If this condition could be cured I am sure there would be great joy and happines, It is a life wrecker and I feel that a short course will never make things better than they are now."
"Access to Services","The therapy session should last more than 30 minutes. it goes very quickly, should be at least an hour. "
"Access to Services","The only imporvement would be seeing the therapist closer to home as getting here hasn't always been easy."
"Environment/Facilities","Not so many stairs"
"Communication","I got depressed with some of the questions on the questionnaire (this form could be improved)  "
"Access to Services","The waiting time for an appointment is too long and getting treatment locally made the wait longer."
"Access to Services","I wish there would have been more sessions."
"Communication","Routine measures form - the data that this form provides is seriously skewed by the fact that it is so difficult to fill in when mood is changeable, leading to it having little benefit.I could feel ok for a number of days but feel down when filling it in which meant I filled it in more negatively than I might have done another day. Also, the very act of filling it in brought me down as it made me think about how I had felt previously, which dragged me down again. Also you need another column as there is a big difference between not at all and several days eg low for 2 days - several is too many. I struggled to fill this in every week and actually hated it."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More practical one to one discussion - too much general stuff, more appropriate to the therapist than the patient, just too much information to take in with much of it of little use to my particular problem"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time for therapy/counselling. "
"Care/ Treatment","Although my counsellor was a good listener and it was helpful to have someone to talk to about my problems I felt that my main problem, of how to deal with someone with a personality disorder (narcissim/BPD/sociopathy) was not addressed.  It would be helpful if some specialists in personality disorders were available  I have learnt more about dealing with such people by reading books/websites.  Before the counselling sessions, I had attempted suicide to escape from narcassistic abuse."
"Access to Services","Wanted more sessions.difficult to attend regularly due to 2 jobs"
"Access to Services","More local appointment options (though I understood this may not always be possible) ie location/time/day.  Being given the option of preferrable contact options (letter, text, email etc)"
"Access to Services","Would like more appointments."
"Food","A cup of tea on the first session"
"Care/ Treatment","First attended the stress control course at Mansfield Town Football Club, it didnt really help but tried to make it fit my needs (Did not like the voice on the CD).  Bit rushed at times also.  Did get on with the Counselling course which my GP wanted me to do in the first place ...  Think 6 weeks is not enough - 8 weeks would have been more suitable or 1.5 hour sessions instead? Understand its a busy service but maybe employ more staff for the need of the service."
"Access to Services","The course and presenters were very good however I felt that at my time of most need my GP was helpful. Once being passed to counselling the speed of support and time provided was limited.  Main issues - long time speaking to someone, phone calls were the only way of speaking to someone out of hours, calls spent going over forms with no solid action, lack of face to face time ""with confident"""
"Access to Services","Felt it was a very long time to wit, six months, to see a therapist."
"Access to Services","The only addition to make would be more sessions for people who need them (I had the maximum 6 allowed) Other than that it is a 5-star service for which I am very grateful."
"Access to Services","I was first offered a group course in relaxation and de-stressing techniques which I was looking forward to, but this was held on two nights, one on which I worked and the other night was far too far away in Newark as I dont have a car - (disappointing).  Chloe is a lovely lady and has given me good strategies which have helped quite a bit.  Thank you"
"Access to Services","It took nearly 6 months before I was assigned a therapist "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I find talking about these things a bit difficult over the phone - face to face sessions would have been preferred but it hasn't been as ""weird"" as I expected."
"Access to Services","More-sessions"
"Access to Services","No other than getting on to the course quicker. "
"Access to Services","I feel that I need so much longer to readjust my thinking and my lifestyle. Siz sessions have made me aware of my problems but I now need help to overcome them."
"Access to Services","Very happy with the therapy provided, just would say that it needs to be provided more quickly.  Extremely likely that patient would recommend the service to a family member or friend."
"Access to Services","I were very satisified with the help given but I do think more help and more appointments would be beneficial"
"Care/ Treatment","It wasn't what I expected - the options were not really discussed. I prefer a face to face approach and someone to explain things to me. "
"Access to Services","Shorter time between assessment and being seen by the therapist."
"Access to Services","More session would be beneficial."
"Access to Services","'shorter waiting times'."
"Communication","I am very pleased with my progress, however, I would like to point out that to the ""layman"" the words ""therapy"", ""psychological"", ""behavioural"" etc are all alarming and somewhat off putting.  As I see it the treatment using CBT (!) is about thinking and how to think.  So a simple catch phrase like Help for Healthy Thinking or some such I belie may be better than the linical ""Psychological Therapy"" - Just a thought!"
"Communication","The only improvement I would suggest is on my first visit I was very upset and angry and I didn't feel that I was understood.  I explained that the longer pauses the lady left I felt I didn't know the answer to the question asked anymore.  I didnt feel my first session was successful but after that I was supported well.  I just feel something the first session needed changing and for the lady tounderstand how difficult it was for me."
"Care/ Treatment","To be less score driven"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time."
"Access to Services","The length of time was I feel too long as I had felt I was resolving problems on my own."
"Access to Services","Just more sessions please."
"Care/ Treatment","Not sure if would recommend the course"
"Access to Services","Longer sessions"
"Access to Services","More sessions: longer sessions; due to disability (deaf)."
"Access to Services","I feel that everything was done well.The only thing that I would change would be how long I had to wait to see somebody after my telephone call as I had to wait 3 months before my first treatment session."
"Access to Services","I feel that some perople may benefit from extra sessions  A patient should be able to say 'Im ready to leave'  thursday 19 Sep 2013 was my last session but I'm not ready to leave. "
"Access to Services","First Appointment took far too long from referral and initial phone call gave no information about the length of waiting time, some idication of waiting list i.e. 6 months, 6 weeks, would have been helpful, but when I asked was told 'no idea at all'."
"Access to Services","Shame I had to wait so long to be seen. (6 months or more). "
"Access to Services","Waiting for the first appointment was very stressful-almost at the point of dispair-I waited 7 months"
"Care/ Treatment","I would improve by if we came to these meetings if the people that was in the group was going through the same as myself"
"Communication","Misunderstanding with appointments but more liaison to stop this from happening."
"Access to Services","Long wait for CBT but appreciate the difficulties in finding a therapist in this area and burden of patient load on service. "
"Access to Services","Extended and more sessions preferred."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Professional Help to enable clarity in my complicated exhausting situation. Thank you Sue"
"Access to Services","Waited a while someone to contact me when I really needed it. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times. Option to continue with therapy/support for longer An initial face to face assessment before going on the waiting list - I was initially referred for eating problems as well as depression  but after waiting for 18 months I find  out that this is unable to be addressed and I need referral elsewhere.  Note added in response to the above by V Bhattacharjee  (Cogntive Behavioural Therapist). I explained to Claire when she presented for treatment with me that due to the number of sessions it would be necessary to prioritise which disorder she felt she would gain most from addressing. She decided to focus on  depression. I explained that following treatment  patient's need to wait 6 months before being re referred to our service to allow for consolidation of learning. I therefore provided information for the Freed Beeches Eating Disorder Service which has a self referral process."
"Access to Services","Very pleased should have started it sooner! "
"Communication","It would be nice to be able to access booklets on websites and have documents emailed."
"Communication","I would strongly suggest a more structured assessment sheet that you have to complete at the beginning of the session. Recommend asking different questions and not repeated. "
"Communication","More discussionk between everyone is needed"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not really relevant.  Slows the process of getting 'real' help.  Not suitable for a lot of people"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Found over the phone being difficult and talking about personal things were hard to discuss. Felt first two session were not long enough, felt that I had to rush what I was saying.  "
"Access to Services","Only criticism was the time had to wait for treatment."
"Access to Services","Would be good if you didnt have to wait as long for help."
"Communication","""Nice to get things off my chest"""
"Access to Services","Didnt think 8 sessions was enough. I learned a great deal but think with more time things wouldnt of seemed so rushed and would of benefited to having more sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","Flexibility in having longer sessions"
"Communication","Would have benefitted from talking to someone - counsellor"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time would be helpful. Counselling changed my thought processes and gaining different point of views. Supportive and challenges which I found helpful. More sessions needed."
"Access to Services","I WAS ON A WAITING LIST FOR JUST UNDER A YEAR."
"Care/ Treatment","The psychological measures form didn't really apply to my situation the problems were anger and the form did not apply to that"
"Access to Services","Longer than 6 weeks"
"Access to Services","Accessing the service was a nightmare!.!  The admin staff do not answer the phone and they use it  self sufficiently to protect their time (is my guess).  They also write letters asking you to turn up for an assessment in person (2 of them) but tell you (when you do finally talk to them) to do it by phone.  The admin is an utter shambles and let' s down the excellent therapists.  The former wants sacking in my view employ a new manager and professional staff."
"Food","Nice to have a cupa tea or glass of water."
"Access to Services","Had to wait a long time, GP had to chase it up. "
"Involvement","No involvement options given."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time and being provided with information about CBT and a recommended list of self help materials for information before therapy began which would help consolidate afterwards"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I didn't like the phone service, prefered the one to one face support. "
"Access to Services","The time it takes to get your first appointment is too long."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time for initial appointment"
"Access to Services","If you could have more sessions I could talk about problems without feeling pressured into naming."
"Access to Services","Long wait but appreciates that a lot of people need help. Was gald to be seen at nearest place and for flexibility of appointments when he had to canvel due to his mum"
"Access to Services","Not much time between getting the letter for the stress class and attending not much choice of venues, struggled to get there.  Telephone has been of great benefit. "
"Access to Services","I had to wait a year for the initial app't. If I had been suicidal:a.I would not have said so on a phone call & b.it would have been too late. "
"Access to Services","apart from the long wait for my appointment that made my recovery much harder without any help I was completely happy with the treatmentwhen I eventually got an appointment and now feel i have much more cahnce of coping if I have another low episode and know I will only have to wait two weeks for referral is very reassuring for the future"
"Access to Services","Helpful to be able to contact for booster, Glad to be held for a while to help me decide if I was Ok.  Glad that I can contact you if I need you in the future because my OCD comes and goes."
"Access to Services","I definitely think the amount of time with the client should be longer, more sessions not more hours on one particular session. If I had more time with the therapist , maybe a few weeks I think it would have benefitted me more. Otherwise I have no other complaints or improvement ideas."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","You must try harder"
"Communication","Helpful to be able to ring daughter sometimes for a shorter session. appreciste the books and sheets."
"Access to Services","I am disappointed that no interim letter was sent to confirm my appointment with a counsellor and had a long wait between assessment and treatment. Some of the ways the telephone is answered was not clear that I was talking to Letstalkwellbeing as people answere just saying ""wellbeing"".  "
"Access to Services","See people quicker and offer more home visits"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Im not going to go as far as to say the therapist shouldnt be in the job she is doing but she didnt seem that interested in listening to me or paying a lot of attention.  She also seemed to be trying to put words into my mouth to try to move the situation on.  We focused on my work situation but this was just one issue that was effecting by feelings.  I went into the therapy hoping to find some real answers as to why i am the way i am and hoped she may at least show me another way of looking at things.  But we didnt even cover most of my problems.  I feel the sessions were cut short because of this.  Also it seems the sessions were cut short due to there being a lack of venue anymore since The Diamond in Kirkby has had to close.  Pathetic really.  Please do not confuse my opinions as being aimed at the STaR worker.  Catherine was great and covered her field well.  There is a seperate questionnaire completed for her."
"Communication","The weekly questionnaire needs looking at, the suicidal questions?  By the time you have finished reading them (if you were that way inclined) you'd be thinking 2is this something I should be thinking about""?  I'd like to thank Vicki for listening."
"Access to Services","Not a comment for this service more directed at GP's. I think this has been a very benefical service for me and its a real shame that it was not offered to me when I saw 3 different GP's at Highcroft surgery, Arnold re: Stress/Anxiety. It was only because I saw a Poster at the GP Practice adverting Lets Talk Wellbeing that I asked the GP to refer me."
"Access to Services","Health visitors should be able to refer directly to the service. Make sure health advisors don't oversell the service - be clear what is available  which would help patient's to moderate their expectations (e.g. reading a book and talking on the phone) A reading list whilst on the waiting list would be good "
"Communication","Improvement on communication from the time of the initial assessment to the time of first session with therapist.  Being told where you are on waiting list or estimated time you will wait before seeing a therapist"
"Care/ Treatment","Including depth psychological approaches expands, broadens & deepens the service"
"Access to Services","Give more sessions"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Felt slightly strange not working face to face but became used to it - not sure how well therapist could judge how I was doing with no eye contact, body language etc.  Found CBT itself interesting."
"Access to Services","I think if the group sessions lasted long over the course. "
"Communication","Books are useful-sometimes simplistic. Sometimes group talk got off topic and you switch off. Course and teaching overall good. I think I need further help with stress & frustration with children."
"Access to Services","At the screening clinic, felt a follow up call would have been useful, to check whether she had contacted the anger management courses. "
"Access to Services","It would be good to have ongoing contact  for mindfulness follow ups as I found them really helpful."
"Care/ Treatment","Appointments could be closer together instead of waiting a couple of weeks sometimes."
"Communication","Time allocated a good thing.  No suggestion of we've got to be moving on."
"Communication","Some questions on this form need revamping, patients come to the service wanting professional opinion on tpye of most useful help reqiuired. Otherwise experience of using the service has been good."
"Access to Services","Quicker waiting times."
"Communication","Some of the above questions are irrelevent. "
"Access to Services","Extended period of sessions."
"Access to Services","I would have preferred more sessions if possible. I feel we have only just begun and now it has ended.  I feel left alone and let down currently, which is part of the reason I came in the first place."
"Access to Services","I was disappointed with the wait for treatment. I was referred to a group which did not run. I think that more groups are needed to reduce waiting time."
"Communication","I felt that I needed to contact the service to remind them rather than the other way round. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting list would improve the service would prefer it if I was able to have more sessions"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The stress control course, there was one lady ( not tammy) who came across as though she wasn't interested.  "
"Access to Services","Time scale a hinderence."
"Access to Services","Have more available"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","My CBT Therapist was moved to a different workplace half way through my treatment which I found difficult and unsettling.  During counselling sessions we had a couple of weeks in between appointments which I actually found useful, as I was able to reflect on what we had discussed and it gave me a chance to implement these new ideas/suggestions before our next session"
"Care/ Treatment","Seemed to have lots of assessments prior to starting treatment which were unnecessary. When treatment did start Karen was satisfied with the treatment she received."
"Access to Services","Waiting times should be shortened for more severe cases such as mine."
"Access to Services","With the waiting list being long by the time I had received my workshop 5 week course, my situation had become even more difficult and then having to wait a further 5 weeks.  This became more and more difficult with my situation. "
"Access to Services","Possibly only being a little more flexible around session timings. Was the same day and time every week which sometimes is difficult to work around with job."
"Access to Services","More than pleased with my therapist but felt he had his hands tied regarding the required time needed for my personal position.  Therapy was stopped before I was ready, therefore I regressed and had to re-apply for further help.  This could have been avoided if therapist was given the final decision on their case/experience of the individuals needs."
"Communication","Need to fill out forms every contact needs to be reviewed The therapist should have a choice of how to assess the client and when To have to fill out the questionnaire at every point of contact was very overwhelming, and I thought at times that it was unnecessary.  I was 'expected' to comply and fill out the form even when no productive sessions had taken place.  At times the forms only served to make the focus on how ill I was, when little help ensued sirectly afterwards.  Some of the questions were confusing and difficult to understand - eg the scales questions.  The suicide questions are mechanistic, cold and insensitive - quite crude and unsophisticated which does not reflect the most excellent and skilled talking therapy I experienced."
"Access to Services","I attended an initial meeting.  There I was told what could be offered to me - after a discussion about my situation.  I had no idea what to do - I was stressed!!  I needed help.  Following that meeting it was about 4 months before I was allocated a place.  I feel that this was far too long.  It also took a long time to be offered this by a Dr.  Only when a female locum saw me, was this offered.  I really enjoyed the course and feel that it should be offered more readily.  I also think that Yoga would compliment a lot of the lessons."
"Access to Services","He feels he has been dissatisfied as at his intiail appointment the clinician hadn't arrived to the appointment and he felt it was 'horriable rearragned' then it was over the phone, which felt 'unsatisfactory'.   He would have preferred face to face rather than the phone, but it has been benefical.   "
"Access to Services","There was quite a big wait between initial appointment/assessment and the first session. The first session then came giving me about 3 days notice which is a little impracticle."
"Access to Services","The option to extend beyond 10 face to face sessions"
"Access to Services","Quicker appointment time between assessment and first appointment."
"Access to Services","More sessions, maybe 10"
"Access to Services","Stability of location.  More information on waiting times"
"Access to Services","Would have nenefited more if first appointment was sooner than it was.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","At the beginning of my treatment I was allocated a star worker to help me with practical tasks, such as visiting groups and accessing services. However, I believe this service has now been withdrawn. The help that I was given by the star worker was invaluable to me and supported the work that my therapist was doing. I would like to see this part of the service reinstated."
"Access to Services","More sessions/time slots? CBT's availablr for people"
"Care/ Treatment","I was recommended to attend the 5 weeks CBT counselling course.  I have attended all 5 sessions, it seems that only some of the information is relevant to my circumstances and find it hard to apply other information to solve the issues that i have, I am not sure if long term it will be helpful or not, and I find it difficult to apply the solutions to my personal situation."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting list please or contact to say we are still on waiting list. "
"Care/ Treatment","Not sure if its made any difference - I still keep getting wound up"
"Access to Services","Longer sessions preferred (more than six weeks). "
"Access to Services","Would have liked therapy to have been sooner. Waiting time too long"
"Communication","I would have liked to have known more about the course prior to agreeing to come on. "
"Access to Services","I live in Derby so would have liked a clinic closer to home. Found access to service very quick and having to wait for treatment wouldnt have bothered me. "
"Privacy and Dignity","I specially asked for a female therapist - but I was satisfied in the end. Also I had a very long wait  Treatment too short - I would have liked more than 8 sessions."
"Communication","Someone at the end of the phone if needed when not in therapy (i.e. inbetween sessions if feeling really down and need to talk)"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Was hoping to be given advice and now realise this is not what counselling offers. Would like to have attended for longer."
"Access to Services","The waiting time for my first consultation was in my opinion too long.  I had to wait around 2 months.  Also I think only having 6/8 sessions should be increased.  I need more sessions but have not got to re-register"
"Access to Services","The waiting time for the first appointment could be shortened but the overall experience was superb.  Just what I needed and many thanks to the therapist who helped me through this !!"
"Access to Services","6 weeks of treatment isnt long enough to deal with my anxieties. The work we did was good but some more is needed"
"Access to Services","My orriginal referral for CBT got lost so I had to refer again. Don't loose referrals! Keep self referal waiting times to an absolute minimum. More money from the NHS so that this service can be offered more freely. Keep communication channels between doctors and therapists open."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It is not helpful to have a lot of changes of worker if this can be avoided."
"Access to Services","The only thing I would change is the waiting time - i had to wait four months for my first appointment."
"Access to Services","I'm aware that the waiting times are due to overwhelming demand, however I feel that this is an incredibly important service that should be offered quicker. Greater funding for this project is absolutely essential, and would almost certainly cause a decrease in emergency interventions."
"Access to Services","I would like to have been seen at my local doctors surgery as was possible in the past."
"Access to Services","My 1st & 6th appointments were filling in forms and chatting.  So I only had 4 sessions of 50 mins.  I didn't find this to be enough time to ""let it all out"" I will probably apply for more sessions so that I can get to the bottom of my problems."
"Access to Services","I had 6 sessions of counselling but I don't think it is long enough and could have done with a bit longer. I am really satisfied with everything else."
"Communication","Make contacting therapists easier in the event of unplanned non-attendance to an appointment."
"Access to Services","Reduce time between contacting GP about therapy to the assessment."
"Access to Services","The resources should be developed where possible to reduce waiting times. I was at crisis point but wasn't able to see someone for a number of weeks."
"Communication","At times it has proved  very difficult to get in touch with the office.  I understand that it is possible to hav a further six sessions and that can only be a good thing, obviously this would only apply if you feel the need for further therapy"
"Communication","Please could you have an easier way to contact yourselves. The main number to contact is always engaged or never gets answered."
"Access to Services","I would have benefitted from being seen for treatment as symptoms deterioated whilst I was waiting."
"Access to Services","Shame it didn't work out and that I couldn't come to the sessions as planned. Sessions I did attend I thought were very good."
"Access to Services","Consitency of therapy pertaining to each individual patient and not the government's time-table of therapy availability (limited number of sessions)"
"Communication","Programmes packed with information. A lot to absorb found I needed to take notes of explainations - course printed notes good to refer to but explainations invaluable but many explainations of each topic can loose point. Overall some really valuable suggestions."
"Access to Services","Perhaps long block of sessions. Counselling has proved the reinforcement of my opinions and ideas by when talked through, these were enforced by myself. I found it helpful. Strategies were also helpful."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time to be seen sooner.  Talking through issues was helpful. Using strategies, e.g. exercises took my mind briefly off issues. Better understanding of feelings of personal feelings/issyes."
"Access to Services","I was informed and agreed a one to one course, after waiting two weeks I was told that it would take 3 months. I therefore had to chase daily to get on the group course and missed the first lession. Better information on leap-times to GP's would help in making decisions"
"Access to Services","Open discussions/ with patient approval - More personal approach as some people may get more from this. I feel that follow up at a later date to assess a patients ongoing improvement coping with lifes problems"
"Care/ Treatment","The phone therapy did not suit me"
"Access to Services","Follow up sessions - 6 monthly/ annual check ups."
"Access to Services","The only thing i was disatisfied with was waiting for the first appointment. It was about 8 or 9 months. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The group CBT sessions originally offered were awful. very disorganised, disjointed and disappointing. ."
"Access to Services","Shorten waitinglist"
"Access to Services","I have independently been referred to a psychologist for further treatment, and my time with Paula has helped me through some very difficult times and made a difference to me, but I need further help with my issues."
"Access to Services","My circumstances have made this course of limited use, although this is no fault of the course.  Only real issue was waiting 6 months before treatment"
"Access to Services","Too long a waiting time before treatment"
"Environment/Facilities","Your staff need more resources."
"Access to Services","Due to waiting time feels alot of recovery done whilst waiting. Opinion of service may be more positive if seen earlier. "
"Communication","Oppertunity for discussion at the session would have been helpful though I appreciate that it would be time consuming"
"Access to Services","Length of time but undertsood the reason as I wanted 1-1."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Prefer face to face rather than telephone it is more personal and 6 sessions are too short. If have to come back into the service wolud see someone don't know and have to start again to build up confidence a couple more session would be better."
"Access to Services","Waiting list."
"Access to Services","It would have been very helpful to have had help sooner."
"Care/ Treatment","I think a break out session might be useful if people WANTED to talk through any issues."
"Access to Services","The only thing I would change is the waiting time - It was unacceptable given my circumstances."
"Access to Services","Its a good service but not enough groups or follow up treatment, not enough support and understanding for people with mental health problems"
"Access to Services","Apart from the wait it was really good once started. "
"Access to Services","Had to wait 6 months - long time. "
"Access to Services","Not happy that it took nearly a year of waiting to have treatment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I have been fine with phone contact but option for face-to-face should be an option. a very friendly voice. "
"Access to Services","Time factor. Was told 6-8 weeks but time went on and waited 8 months. Should be made more clear on how long people have to wait. "
"Access to Services","Appalled at the time i had to wait for treatment"
"Access to Services","Waiting times - communication."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Found over the phone difficult and 30 minutes was not long enough"
"Access to Services","Still waiting for an appointment for 1:1. I think I will benefit from seeing one.  I will be satisfied when I have seen a counsellor to help me go through things. I have enjoyed attending stress Control but it has been a struggle at times due to being a single parent and no close family at hand. Had to rely on a friend. I still feel that I need to see someone to work through things and get to the bottom of things that have happened to me ove the past few years"
"Access to Services","I feel that 6 sessions is not enough."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was initially offered a stress therapy course which I was dissatisfied with. I had to request 1-1 counselling. The initial stress course was unprofessionally delivered which is why I only attended 1 session and then requested 1-1 counselling. I was satisfied with the counselling therapist but felt i was given no choice but to attend a stress counselling course which i knew was unsuitable to my needs and was unprofessionally delivered."
"Access to Services","Reduce waiting time for first appointment"
"Access to Services","Possibly would have been helpful to have sessions sooner when I was signed off work Oct/Sept (5 months from signed off to first session) However sessions have still been helpful."
"Access to Services","The telephone has been a really bad form of therapy, it's been fine for me but I think it would be better spent face to face. "
"Access to Services","Limit on sessions"
"Access to Services","The service has been helpful but I had to wait nearly 3 months for my referral which meant I didn't get to see anyone whilstI was feeling at my lowest. It has been helpful in terms of helping me to identify my signs and symptoms and how to handle these in future though."
"Care/ Treatment","In retrospect it would have been better to have spaced sessions out due to my busy lifestyle. However, I do understand this was something I could of asked for.  "
"Access to Services","First appointment shorter waiting time first appointment for 2 hours or 1 1/2 hours more avaialbility of mindfulness courses good understanding of self achieved by problem profile claearer understanding of qualities"
"Access to Services","I am very satisfied with my sessions to date but do feel I still need more help and time to cope with my past. I will be asking for a referral and hope this can be sorted A.S.A.P and I wisa my sessions were not ending today as this is my last one of this block"
"Access to Services","Therapy sessions were ended sooner than I felt they should have been. There was a fear of not having the support that had and was helping me"
"Access to Services","Waiting times reduced between initial assessment and first session with therapist, this would improve the service.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More face to face sessions would be the only thing I would have changed"
"Access to Services","Would like to see more of us please at the beginning of the group"
"Access to Services","the only improvement that I would make is the waiting time for this treatment.  I had to wait over a year for my appointment which I found frustrating.  "
"Communication","Thought it was an exercise class she was going to. So more information about what the class was would have been useful. Another patient upset me when she talked about her family. Felt frustrated for her, I just wanted her to tell them to leave her alone."
"Access to Services","The delay. 1 being assessed and 2 being allocated a therapist should be addressed by better communication. It should not be difficult to generate an automatic text / email / letter on a weekly basis to track my progress in the que together with an explanation for any increased delay (e.g. influx of emergency patients) You jut need a decent EPR system."
"Care/ Treatment","I very much felt that this form of treatment was the only option andit was extremely rigid, the counsellor I had was very good and the treatment did work on this occassion but that was becauce I had the drive to make it work.n That might not have been the case for someone else, the treatment feels very impersonal."
"Access to Services","Although the waiting time for the first appointment was long, the counselling I received was helpful."
"Involvement","Mental health problems are isolating. This course heightened that sense of isolation as we were not able to participate in any way nor to interact nor ask questions.  Its ok to listen but better to talk."
"Access to Services","The waiting list was too long."
"Access to Services","Initial period could be quicker had to wait 7-8 months to get on course. "
"Access to Services","Long wait for counselling"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The only reason I continued with these sessions was my GP, so I could get one:one session with a therapist ( qualifies) as I really need help.  "
"Communication","I would like a contact number to ring in case I need someone to encourage me or run through something with me"
"Access to Services","Please inform potential clients that the wait time for a therapist could bhe 6-9 months! Hanging on or waiting for a phone call each day is nerve wracking and leads to more frustration and lack of control. "
"Access to Services","I would like to see a inmprovement from first assessment to see what treatment would suit you best to actually recieving the treatment. The time span between them to be shortened. I felt I had been forgotten and I am sorry  I don't think yo can do treatment over the phone until you have meet the person first. Felt a bit spooky for me."
"Care/ Treatment","Not impressed with Stress Control Course people did not seem to know what they where doing unless that was the nature of the material in the course. "
"Access to Services","Some of us feel we need more appointments and don't need under 6-10 seessions. Note from BM: Patient wants longer term therapy and feels our service offers too few appointemtns for her needs.  Signposted her to PHysical health specialty at Kings Mill HOspital. Her consultant can refer her."
"Access to Services","Appreciate that the demand is high but the time from seeing my GP and recognising I have a problem to seeing a therapist was far too great and whilst you talk about making certain you catch people before it gets to point of possible suicide.  I felt isolated"
"Access to Services","Maybe more places to see a therapist, local. I had to travel a distance of 10 miles. I needed to have a car. Difficult bus travel."
"Access to Services","I felt the timescales in the first instance were long and that I would like to have begun therapy when I felt so vulnerable. The second service, group bereavement therapy has not yet happened and I would like the wait to be shorter. I would like the length of the sessions to be  open-ended although financing is an issue. "
"Care/ Treatment","Felt that the course was a bit rushed, dont know whether that is me or the course."
"Access to Services","Was not happy with wait time stress management inappropreate for my need sit was dry and boring content interesting but delivery was just awful it needed to have time where you could interact with people within the class share experiences and learn from each other I am a primary teacher and would like to run this course"
"Access to Services","Attended stress control, on a waiting list for CBT, told there was a six month waiting list in January."
"Access to Services","Quicker time from seeing GP to therapist. ?? (Never) consulted regarding with whom and where I was placed at first"
"Access to Services","Long time between doing stress control course and getting to see Counsellor.  Should have been sooner."
"Access to Services","Please be more realistic when giving information regarding waiting time.  I was told I would wait only up to 3 months, in fact i waited 5"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","There should be more face to face sessions once treatment had started.  In the first appointment (screening) the therpaist shouldn't keep looking at a clearly visible clock which can make you feel uncomfortable and like they aren't listening.  Appointment letters or confirmation's should give an indication of how long appointment's will be."
"Care/ Treatment","Need more understanding about deaf awareness for therapist when meet deaf patients. Needdeaf therapist of counsellor for deaf patients."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times. Better choice and more appointment times to be available."
"Access to Services","Not a Final Review Appointment, Have not given patient questionnaire."
"Care/ Treatment","Previously before my 1-1 with my therapist i had to take part in group therapy for 6 weeks. I didn't find this helpful and I struggled to relate to my own problems. Also i found it hard to be part of a group for fear of being recognised and i found it hard to concentrate though embarressment. Time individually with my therapist was much more sucessful."
"Access to Services","Make it available to more patients at the onset of their problems - this way the root of the problems can be diagnosed earlier. "
"Access to Services","I did feel the length of time to wait for treatment was a bit too long.  Perhaps to offer a follow up appointment after 6 months to find out how people were getting on. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","In my opinion an older therapist with more life experience would have been more beneficial. The young therapist I encounted were very kind and acted in a professional manner but I was hesitant at times to say how I felt or how past issues still affected me because it would have been difficult for them to empathise fully. Use of office other than NHS premises didn't feel apropriate or comfortable."
"Access to Services","I feel the therapy should be longer than sex weeks although I know you can self refer yourself back in which I will most likely do in the near future.  Which I would also like to be able to have the choice to see the same therapist (Pauline).  I do feel thats important too.  Thank you Pauline."
"Communication","I would have liked longer therapy than 12 sessions."
"Access to Services","Longer sessions if possible"
"Care/ Treatment","Dan and Zoe were great but it would be nice to have had more options open to me."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I still feel depressed and anxious but also very self conscious. I have no confidence or self belief and this is stopping me from moving on. I need help to rebuild my confidence, but this has not happened except in counselling which has finished"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would of prefered face to face, I dont Know why."
"Communication","Venues not always clear, lack of communication not clear. "
"Access to Services","I thought I would need a lot longer to feel better. I don't think I need bereavement help now either. "
"Care/ Treatment","Offering wider range if therapies."
"Access to Services","I feel that patients should be seen sooner I feel I need more help but none has been offered other than repeating the treatment"
"Care/ Treatment","Offer more solutions. This course did not cover areas related to me"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I prefer face to face appointments. "
"Environment/Facilities","I cant think of anything that would improve it except that the room was a physically clinical (ie it had an examination couch in it).  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I cant seem to overcome my anxiety - i hope there is somethign else i can try later. I will call lets talk in a few weeks or so"
"Care/ Treatment","Only thing that could improve the service is more availability with appointments, other than that I was extremely satisfied with the treatment"
"Access to Services","Longer sessions required. A place to come and talk through things and get things off my mind."
"Access to Services","I think this service could be improved by  having the appointments in the same place.  Other than this, I am very happy with the service."
"Involvement","Decisions taken - when would this happen becasue I do not remember being asked about care/treatment - only asked if I would like to be involved with a course on stress control - no other options were discussed.  I have had help from the lady who has called me on 3 times to encourage me to get more involved in 'people activities' - Excellent feed back a lovely person.  Provided losts of leaflets with loads of suggestions and will be following up with them"
"Access to Services","More time - 1 and a half hours would be better as it takes half an hour to say hello and settle down!  Water bottles and tissues would be nice or a water tap one can help oneself to, as you become very dry, all the talking!  "
"Access to Services","More access needs to be offered to the service, increase the public awareness of the service"
"Access to Services","Allow for one on one sessions with long term illnesses and problems.  Don't make people feel like they should drop all safety behaviours all at once or that medications is only short term option.  Feels very one tract - doesn't really focus on the why just what to do to get back to normal.  Information given was very useful but bery difficult to implement into real life for long term problems, but my doctor has been aware of and made this as an interim for now "
"Access to Services","I think the waitinhg time to see a therapist is very slow.  When I really needed to talk to a therpist after seeing my doctor it was too long leaving me very distressed and alone. Need to make waiting list shorter."
"Access to Services","Access time to services."
"Access to Services","'Waiting times to be cut, however staffing is an issue'.    "
"Access to Services","Was at a very low point in January & started counselling in April.  I would have benefitted sooner.  Q12.  Patient indicated that they would be extremely likely to recommend the service to a family member of friend."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Main issue was outbursts of rage and feel this not addressed fully. Was happy with therapist but not enough knowledge of brain condition after a haemorhage."
"Access to Services","I wish there was an emergency service for this kind of thing, as when I was really ill I had no help. I also had to wait a year for the initial treatment "
"Access to Services","It is rather disappointing that there is no provision after standard office hours. This has caused me some difficulty getting away from work. When I was initially contacted and I enquired about this, It was suggested that if I wanted an evening appointment I should go private! Most unhelpful and quite upsetting having waited over a year to see someone."
"Involvement","More involvement would be good ie questionnaires - comments points of view, incidents occurring from time to time (no details neccessary)would help people etc."
"Access to Services","Quicker access to the service."
"Access to Services","I had to wait over a year for treatment, because I am on medication this was ok, but otherwise not good!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Although the course is very good I don't feel it meets my personal needs and maybe 1-1 counselling may be more appropriate given the things that have caused me stress/anxiety. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss further."
"Access to Services","I think it did take a while for my first appointment to come through, but gave me a chance to prepare, as to what might be involved with the treatment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Happy with what I had. I would have liked face to face."
"Care/ Treatment","Having stated that I was not interested in further Cognitive Therapy, having done a great deal of it before, I was encouraged to do this stress course which I found to be mostly CBT based. I was informed that I needed to complete the course before I could recieve alternative therapies. I applied for Primary care for depression in NOvember 2009."
"Privacy and Dignity","My first screening appointment was with a young male trainee.  He asked if I could be videoed throughout the sessions including the first screening session (the camera was already set up).  I felt a bit overwhelmed and as such asked to change therapists."
"Access to Services","Waiting time for first appointment was to long"
"Access to Services","This stres scontrol would have been more useful had I been offered a place 2 or 3 weeks after my first telephone appointment. My doctor enquired as to why it had taken so long to get in touch in the first place. It took about 6 months from the telephone interview to getting on a course that fitted with my work, by which time I was feeling better. I could have improved faster with the information from the course."
"Access to Services","Reduced waiting list."
"Access to Services","Better to go on stress control course first it starts you off although it was a long time to wait for treatment and could be worrying for some people and don't think the course would be helpful for them. Thank you."
"Access to Services","I don't think the number of sessions should be restricted. "
"Access to Services","Once I got to see Rachel I was really pleased, but I wasn't satisfied with the amount of time I had to wait as I wasn't in a fit frame of mind to wait as long as I did."
"Access to Services","Felt I waited to long for first appointment, so some changes for quicker appointment time.  Counselling made me more positive, made me aware of what I have than not have. More motivateds to overcome things and find out more. Made me more stronger. Puts me more in a positive line to change my stance and look at retraining to be a British Sign Language therapist"
"Access to Services","Only the time taken until the first appointment; everything else was excellent."
"Care/ Treatment","Method of delivery not helpful but not ready to engage at this time. Have not made any decisions so cannot answer questions regarding this. Face to face would have been better didn't realise had that option. Dissatisfied to my lack of engagement not therapist comments or suggestions."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not keen on Telephone counselling"
"Access to Services","It would have been better if there were more sessions available but I've had a very positive experience."
"Access to Services","Therapy to be available in the evenings. "
"Access to Services","Initially I found it very difficult to engage with the service and felt that the more structured approach (contract) that came with the CBT treatment was better."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I find the telephone sessions a bit a weird, it's easy to talk to you but not quite as engaged as in face to face. It sometimes feels easier to talk face to face. "
"Access to Services","Less waiting time i.e. 12 weeks is a long time to wait when you feel pretty desperate. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Phone counselling found this difficult, would have preferred face to face.  Being at home some distraction."
"Access to Services","Longer (more sessions) please"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Fewer telephone appointments, face to face gives the patient more opportunities to explore ways"
"Access to Services","You should not have to wait that long for the first appointment. There is a limited amount of sessions you should have the option to carry on until you feel ready. I was not imformed that I was on the waiting list."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When I was first told about the phone work I was a bit dubious, but it's worked out OK."
"Access to Services","Discharged quickly after course of treatment, felt ongoing care until felt ok to go it alone may have been better although was given option to self refer."
"Access to Services","I feel the sessions could perhaps be slightly longer. "
"Care/ Treatment","Not sure worked for me and am grateful for the time I got. Not pressured to do this or that still have same stresses but better at balancing them and think it has been great."
"Access to Services","Shorten the waiting time for first appointment.  This was many weeks in my case."
"Care/ Treatment","Over the phone is better at home and feel more relaxed. would feel stressed to attend an appointment so its a lot better for me at home."
"Environment/Facilities","In terms of environment - the room I met my therapist in was not conducive to relaxation. It was small and clautrophobic - lucky I wasn't having treatment for claustrophobia!"
"Access to Services","More sessions longer appointments"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More funding to be made available so that there can be more counsellors to reduce waiting time.  More help given to people with physical problems rather than psychological ones. This balance needs to be addressed."
"Access to Services","To be seen as soon as possible and begin therapy as soon as possible."
"Access to Services","I think I would have benefitted from a few more sessions, as I found it quite hard to open up at first, so the last sessions became more intense."
"Access to Services","Shortening the waiting time for the first appointment, but I appreciate how busy you must be."
"Access to Services","Quicker turnaround for treatment appointnment (from screening). Appointments closer to home (traveled 20 mins by bus to get to apps)"
"Access to Services","Better management when 1st worker was off long term needed. I was left waiting over six months. Not good!"
"Care/ Treatment","More than one assessment may have altered the type of therapy i received. PWP work i would have been seen quicker. From time of assessment to treatment took 4 months and i already began to feel better."
"Access to Services","More sessions would be good"
"Access to Services","This questionnaire has some very strange qustions numbers 7&8.  I felt it was very helpful to attemd a local venue that was a non-NHS/medical and it felt more user friendly and non-threatenng."
"Access to Services","Referral made by my GP was not acknowledged so therefore I had to wait a long time for  an appointment.   "
"Communication","Better questionnaires"
"Access to Services","Only if treatment could come a little quicker but I realise that therapists are very busy"
"Communication","A more structured first session explaining CBT, how it works, chances of success etc. More structure in general would have helped. Venue was not great, noisy, run down, but I know a new clinic is being built."
"Access to Services","I'd would have liked it to go on longer, but I undersood that it would be this long prior to entering therapy."
"Access to Services","Travel:- It has been nice to have a local service in my home town, have had previous counselling and this was some disctance away-which has proved difficult for time and cost."
"Access to Services","The waiting time from the assessment to the first appointment ewas to long.  I had to ring a couple of times to make sure I was still on the ewaiting list, hopefully waiting times could be improved on as i found I needed to talk to someone sooner. I found everyone I spoke to very helpful.  Thank you."
"Access to Services","Less of waiting time"
"Access to Services","Reduce waiting times"
"Access to Services","Nothing apart from shorter waiting times, although I think in my case it was helpful as I was more ready for therapy by waiting."
"Access to Services","Shorter time from initial assessment to CBT Sessions"
"Access to Services","Wait time-after initial assessment and treatment (reduce) time taken. One initial assessment before treatment (not two) More information regarding treatment offered and choice of treatment (?) "
"Access to Services","Just less time to wait before you can first see someone to talk to."
"Access to Services","Possibly the option to extend treatment immediately after the 8 seszsions if necessary rather than have to wait three months to self refer. Other than that my counsellor Melanie Taylor was a pleasure to speak to and I could not have asked for a nicer lady.  I looked forward to my sessions and feel comfortable asking to see her again if necessary. (Smiley face)"
"Access to Services","The waiting time is long, and I felt that if someone had contacted me to state how long I would wait - this would have been helpful. It would have been nice to have been contacted by phone once a month advising where you where on the waiting list and how much longer you would have to wait."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Telephone support- would have benefited from face-to-face. "
"Food","CBT has been a great help to me. It's a shame waiting times are so long."
"Access to Services","To reduce the waiting time for the service.  I could have really done with the hjelp sooner rathern than wait 4-5 months. Other than that the service has been very useful, and my therapist Bill Miller  has been excellent. in terms of helping me see the loss of my marriage to be a good thing, so that I can move onto a positive future and leave the bad times behind me."
"Access to Services","To reduce waiting times for therapy."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time"
"Involvement","I was advised at my initial 1 :1 counselling that I would be referred to a group counselling session where I would be able (if I wished) to talk about my personal problems. However, this was not the group I was referred to. No personal input was part of the course."
"Care/ Treatment","Having more interaction. feel as though we've been talked at. Felt we couldn't ask questions"
"Communication","Difficulties getting through to office number, nobody to talk to.  Broken sessions due to therapist cancellations, was not kept informed of things when changed therapists."
"Communication","Before committing to first appointment its explained you need to have 6 consecutive sessions."
"Communication","better questionnaires - the two I have used are not fit for purpose, badly laid out and onfusing. Despite the poor general administration I found the counsellor extremely helpful and wld recommend the service but with the proviso that the initial customer contact and paperwork leaves a lot to be desired."
"Access to Services","Shorter time between phone assessment and first appointment"
"Communication","Very long wait for treatment."
"Access to Services","Waiting time was 2 months longer than I was told. Wouldl have been helpful for someone to contact in the meantime just to indicate how long roughly."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time. Feel happy, supportive and more confident, self esteem much higher. More time to reflect since counselling, less stress due to better understanding of self. It is extremely likely that I would recommend service to family and friends"
"Access to Services","Would have preferred earlier appointment. I feel more confident now than before. Counselling helped me finding more about myself everyday and enjoying it. Realising I am not, a worthless human being. Enjoying finding inner strength. enjoying - make up and dress more I would highly recommend service to family or friend"
"Access to Services","Waiting time was excessive.  Also phone call to find appropriate route was not as good as I'd have liked.   But eventually very satisfied and would recommend."
"Communication","Possibly an on-line forum for discussing feelings, when you dont feel like talking directly to a person."
"Access to Services","Feel with ther 6-8 sessions always felt there was a time pressure hanging over and the panic of what would do afterwards."
"Access to Services","No consistancy in first contact to service. Time to evaluate things that happened and look at how to deal with them. Independent advice, so was not taking sides. Made me see my own importance and that I have a value. Confidence to say no and stand up for what I want. Have taken step back and now consider how do things affect me and say no if I decided. "
"Access to Services","Just the initial time it took to get the appointment for the first assessment other than that I would highly recommend the service."
"Access to Services","I wished i could have more sessions."
"Communication","Better communication earlier on I think therapy should never take place over a telephone conversation."
"Access to Services","Had to wait from September 2009 to 9th July 2010 before seeing someone, after asking for help several times going back to as early as 2006"
"Care/ Treatment","The offering was too generic & group focused to be of any significant help for me. My allocation to the course was based soley on a short phone call. For the course itself time within for some 1:1 discussions would be valuable."
"Access to Services","Waited too long initially for an appointment. "
"Communication","1) Self help guidance would have been beneficial during the time I was waiting for therapy to start. 2) Numbers to call in an emergency."
"Access to Services","I would like to feel that ""Let's Talk"" will keep in touch with me to monitor how I'm getting on, as I feel it's an ongoing process"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting list!"
"Access to Services","The wait for one-to-one counselling was too long to wait and I am disappointed I have to change my therapist as it feels I have to begin again."
"Access to Services","I think the waiting list could be quicker as was a fairly long wait. "
"Access to Services","Disatisfied with having to go through 3 assessments and long waits in between. Feel I was not very honest about how bad I felt initially though and was not inspired by the service and would not promote it. This is no reflection on you and the 5 area thought work was really helpful and I do tell my friends who agree. I have been like this before but this time it feels different and feel I am going to be fine."
"Access to Services","Im not sure how many people are aware of CBT, im luck that my Gp didnt just give me medication and send me on my way.it might help in  making it more known so people so they can access it even if there GP is not so good, it is a real answer to understanding and really deal with the issues, and understanding psychology. "
"Access to Services","I feel six sessions not enough, maybe 12 or given the option if the group need to go on for longer."
"Access to Services","A shorter waiting time and keeping in touch during the waiting time as I presumed I had been forgotten."
"Access to Services","It should be week not each 2 week so you can get into it.  "
"Care/ Treatment","I was offered a DIY course of CBT, supported by remote telephone interviews.  Whilst I found this successful, I had trouble sustaining the motivation to complete the task sheets and eep detailed records of progress.    Prior to the course, I had experience of CBT methods through supporting my wife's CBT last year.  I would be very concerned about offering a paper heavy course to someone with severe depression and no experience of CBT or home support."
"Access to Services","Issue of 1st therapist leaving & time delay before being picked up by me was hard. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I had two face to face meetings which were followed up by telephone appointment. This worked satisfactory, but I believe individual client/therapist contact would feel more supportive. I wonder whether this decided to the patients need? It worked well enough for me, but if I had continued to feel as I had at the beginning, it would have been more reasuring to have individual meetings rather than a faceless chat on the phone. No criticsm to my therapist - she was very helpful/supportive"
"Access to Services","Less waiting time between being referred by the GP and getting treatment - I felt desperate and felt as if there was no help in place whilst I was waiting. At the assessment all the different treatment were not discussed in detail. More choice of time slots would be good - I was keen not to have time off work to attend these appointments (but ended up having to have some time off) as I had a lot of time off for other medical appointments and did not want work thinking negatively of me and did not want to discuss what I was attending appointments for."
"Access to Services","Possibly to get some feedback on how person is progressing at intervals throughout months of treatment"
"Access to Services","The only comment is regarding the initial admin and that there seemed to be a mix up on arranging the first appointment. "
"Access to Services","I think the assessment period could be longer to benifit the patients outcome for there needs/problems"
"Access to Services","Please try and keep therapist at one venue."
"Communication","As I had never had treatment like this, I don't feel I was given enough information to make in informed decision"
"Access to Services","The therapy was very helpful but had to to wait five months. Also the herapy was finished against my wishes as I felt the things we discussed opened lots of cans of worms but were never taken further. "
"Care/ Treatment","On the first session all of us should have time to get to know each other. The coffee break did help a little to others. If given more time we could form a support group to run with the sessions."
"Access to Services","Other than the length of time I had to wait for an appointment, there is nothing I would change."
"Access to Services","My wait to start therapy was longer due to some miss communication regarding my desire to commence treatment, somewhere along the lines my name was removed from the waiting list and I had to be re-referred. "
"Access to Services","1.Nearer to home.  2.Less waiting time.  3.Other treatments offered at the same time i.e. accupuncture, soft tissue massage, relaxation tapes. Help with diets i.e. things that will help people who are low in themselves i.e. foods with vitamin D in perhaps, 45 gramms dark chocolate"
"Access to Services","12 sessions is short"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More one to one therapy"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time for first appointment."
"Communication","No contact for a month and a half after first consultation and notified it would be starting 3 days before start - not enough time to arrange work cover.  "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time between stress management courses. Improved visability of the graphs relating to the questionnaires. I found this very useful to see how far I had come when sent this after my discharge from the service"
"Access to Services","Waiting times for mental health therapy seems long"
"Care/ Treatment","Maybe some extra computor based taks to coincide with the written tasks set that can be done to reinforce topics/issues covered. "
"Care/ Treatment","Mindfulness for GAD would be very useful."
"Access to Services","Very long wait between assessment and first appointment. Only offered CBT despite it not being approperate for my condition. THerpist had no understanding of learning disabilities or how to djust treatment to cope with mine. Despite being told that I was trandgender "
"Access to Services","shorter waiting time"
"Communication","After initial appointment I was informed that I would receive information about counselling but none was given."
"Communication","May have been usefull to recieve literature with first letter re therapies available. When I went for my appt I was then given two different types of therapy and I thought that appt would be the start of tx. some explenation of this would have been good with that first letter. Thanks"
"Access to Services","Direct referral without GP from one form of therapy to another to CBT to Psych Sexual etc"
"Access to Services","Six session doesn't feel as though there enough. For me personally I feel 8-10 would have meant I would have come out the otherside and still had that support and that I would know I didn't need the support anymore. Where as I know I'm almost there but after my 6th session I've got to face the last bit on my own, especially with my last couple of weeks being the hardest in my life. "
"Access to Services","Not to wait so long to get help. I did expect to have longer as long as my medication, because is it the tablets that help. These sessions have helped but I do not feel it is long enough. My mental state is better than at the begining. I do see doctor 20th March. Just ticking boxes surely does not give a good reading, circumstances change so quickly. Thanks to Pauline."
"Access to Services","I feel like I needed more time with the therapist and the service was finished rather abruptly.  Although more treatment was suggested as an alternative when mentioned it was presented as not the best idea for me.  Maybe more time to discuss what happens when the therapist leaves would be helpful."
"Access to Services","More sessions would definitely have benefitted me."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I did not like over the phone. But found the techniques beneficial"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I don't like the  telephone conversations, I prefer face to face, but I feel that it has worked well, I'm surprised. "
"Access to Services","Only negative thing I can say is that it took a long tme from applying to see someone to actually seeing them - In my case nearly six months."
"Access to Services","Improving the waiting time from going to the doctor to getting an appointment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think it might be nice to see the therapist face to face more often, but I know the reasons for this. My expectations of therapy has changed, I feel i am more realistic now, I used to think it would ""cure you"" . I wish I had known from before coming to the service."
"Access to Services","waiting time much too long, initially sought counselling through alternative provider. "
"Access to Services","Dont let them wait too long. Keep it going."
"Access to Services","The GP should of refered me earlier, I asked 3 months ago and he said I didnt need it, I needed it more 3 months ago!! It has been helpful though."
"Access to Services","It would have to be the waiting time as it was not available when I needed it most"
"Care/ Treatment","Although the therapy sessions have been useful I am unsure if CBT was the best route for me to deal with my issues."
"Access to Services","Make it more available to people.  Too long a wait for therapy but well worth it once it began."
"Access to Services","I feel the initial process from GP to therapist took too long and if it wasn't for my own personal morals about suicide I may have done it before my therapy started!!!"
"Care/ Treatment","It would have been good to have been offered options.  My practitioner was very helpful but was limited to working through a pre-determined set of modules.  The modules themselves would be better without the cartoon characters and the slightly patronising tone.  People like me often have issues with self-esteem and that didnt help."
"Access to Services","I sometimes found the homework a bit overwhelming, but I got it in the end! I think it could have also been closer to where I live."
"Access to Services","Just the amount of time waiting to see somebody"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Perhaps more face to face sessions"
"Access to Services","Not happy with only 6 sessions then you are dropped back into the ocean"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time.  Better advertising about the service and where to get help faster. I feel the doctors want to try to get you to take tablets rather than het this kind of help which I feel has been more beneficial to me.  I have taken some tablets but feel the side effects were more harmful than the good they did.  "
"Access to Services","Process needs to be quicker."
"Care/ Treatment","The 2 main things I like is the grass hopper 5 year rules. I think the place has made it hard for our teachers.  I think as a general course covering a lot of things but not special for me."
"Privacy and Dignity","Venue:- Very pleasant surroundings and close to where I live, however the venue staff didn't seem particularly concerned about privacy for our course. I appreciate there is extensive building work going on, but perhaps they shouldn't have offered to host our course if they were too busy to ensure privacy. Do they realise what the course is about and how intimidating it can be to walk through or have crowds of members in such a proximaty (Week 3 + week 4) particularly when most of the members are men.  I got the impression that because we were such a small group, they couldn't really be bothered; especially on week 5 when the room was double booked and we were put in an annex off the club room with no door or even screen. Perhaps some education on the course content and people attending to the staff would help! The Golf Club is trying to attract new customers - this is Not a good advert for them. I would appreciate if feedback is given to the Golf Club staff.   "
"Access to Services","Just being able to start quicker. I think it took a few months to get an appointment. Since starting the sessions have been great, thanks."
"Communication","Obviously the mix up with locations, rooms, moved about could have been improved."
"Access to Services","Only thing I feel that 6 sessions are definitely not long enough. I feel I have more issues that I have not been able to deal with during the allotted time and feel very sad that today was my last session"
"Access to Services","Longer counselling sessions"
"Access to Services","Maybe less waiting time"
"Access to Services","Needs to be open and available to more people. The sevice is so good it deserves to be advertised more so people are aware that there is help out there and locally."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I think I would of like more face to face, but I really liked the 1-1 as the imput helped me.  It helped me understand myself"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Eye to eye contact with therapists and some opportunity to discuss - maybe at the end"
"Access to Services","Could condense into less sessions for slightly longer per session."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","At initial consultation I felt that once it had been established that I wasn't about to top myself I was essentially dismissed. I aslo felt that if I didnt do the stress course I wouldnt be offered anything else. I'm al;sp not confident thay my situation was thoroughly explored a the first appointment. The stress course did not seem to apply to me. I did attend each session and feel I go little from it. The lack of interaction between the session leaders and the clients seemed to create a barrier. I also found that the staff talked far too fast and just read the powerpoints . I could have done that at home"
"Communication","'Could do with more than one phone line at main office, or divert to answer machine when line is busy.  Found it difficult to get through most of the time.'"
"Access to Services","Not having to wait such a long time before getting to see someone."
"Access to Services","I would like more sessions but realise this is difficult with the workload, however I have found the sessions very helpful and as I am still having some problems, I will probably re-refer myself."
"Involvement","I expressed an opinion about a treatment that had been researched. I argued that I didn't feel it would work in many cases and got told in the following session that the therapist hadn't come up against resistance like that before. This surprised me as I thought therapy was about being honest. I received a slight attitude before persuading that I wasn't being uncooperative. I thought this derailed the treatment and wasn't professional. After this I didnt feel like I could be honest and disagree with anything"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Being given support to help with techniques, course to have open sessions to come to discuss using techniques over the 5 week period"
"Access to Services","Being allowed to have more time"
"Communication","Maybe communication with the occupational health from work could help with understanding problems and continuation of service."
"Access to Services","The only thing I think that would improve the service is if there wasn't a set cut off point.  I think it could be frustrating for both therapist and patient when progress is made but the problem not fully sorted, then the patient is cut loose.During the enforced recess from treatment I think there is the potential for the patient to skip back, and lose all the benefits gained"
"Access to Services","I would have liked the  option to have extended my treatment beyond the set framework."
"Access to Services","More time taken over presentations Things related to everyday situations more"
"Access to Services","I would have liked some more sessions"
"Communication","The books on prescription that i placed on 29th May have yet to be available. However there is a vast library and web with lots of self help that the lack of these books has not been on issue Perhaps a list of useful websites would be useful now as more people use the internet now"
"Access to Services","Not to discharge people after 6 sessions, but wait until they feel they are comfortable carrying on alone"
"Access to Services","Give patient the service they need soon"
"Access to Services","Perhaps longer period regarding weeks of therapy would be more helpful"
"Access to Services","Perhaps longer sessions, e.g. 10; though I feel liften when had therapy.. "
"Care/ Treatment","I think that the group are too buf anf there is a lot to take in.  I cannot do this, it would help if you can explain what's in the pill that we/I have to take, what happen after this program, where do we go?  Are there lots of people like me? Taking thing a little slower as a lot to take in"
"Communication","Would be better to receive all information on all the available services relation to mental health issues in order to make an informed decision about what was best for me, may have chosen more than one area to use to help me with my differet ongoing needs or issues.  Initial assessments repetative I completed a questionnaire at GP, at home prior to first appointment with Let's Talk and then again at the first appointment with therapists.  Is it necessary to do this many assessments initially.  I understand about the need to do it for ongoing care but I'm not sure about it initially."
"Access to Services","Sometimes, half an hour is not long enough on the telephone, I feel I could have talked for longer.  I feel you as the therapist have adapted to my needs and it hasn't just been a tickbox exercise which has been important so thank you. "
"Access to Services","Shorting waiting time for first appointment. "
"Access to Services","More sessions"
"Access to Services","It did not feel like enough sessions.  And it is more personal when sessions are face to face , telephone sessions feel distant.  The short term nature of the work makes me feel I have not learned enough to keep moving forward. "
"Access to Services","only that I wish we had longer overall i'm very happy with the service and the help that i have been given"
"Privacy and Dignity","Although I requested a female therapist I was referred to a male.  I do think requests should be strongly considered, I was very happy with the support but did feel limited in what I could discuss/confide."
"Access to Services","I can only suggest making the sessions longer than six weeks, however being able to phone up and book more sessions seems to be a good idea."
"Access to Services","More sessions if needed"
"Access to Services","I was informed at the beginning that I needed to stay sober for one month and then I would be re-assessed and offered service appropriately. After 4 weeks I was placed on counselling waiting list for 4 months. Initially I was told that I may be supported by different types of therapy straight away. This did not help my mental health, however, once starting counselling; I found it extremely useful and it has helped me to function better in certain situations."
"Communication","SIMPLER QUESTONNAIRES"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have preferred face to face, breaking work done in simple steps, would like more sessions. "
"Access to Services","The amount of sessions were too few. I feel I was quite rushed and dont feel I have benefitted fully from the service. I would suggest more sessions with more explanations and time given to each problem. e.g. anxiety, depression and panic attacks."
"Communication","Nice to have someone to talk to with no connections"
"Access to Services","Longer Periods"
"Involvement","Was not given the choice between CBT and other therapy. CBT was decided for me. "
"Access to Services","More sessions"
"Access to Services","Maybe a follow up appointment when you have finished just to have a chat about how things  are going.  I felt I could really open up ti Bert and he wouldn't judge me.  I felt a bit unsure of myself as I left from my final session.  I have and am doing really well but to know in a few weeks I might just have had a session to go through things that might have perhaps not gone well/down days would be good.  I'm very lucky I have support at home but for perhaps people that don't, I thought it would be a really positive thing to have."
"Access to Services","Being treated sooner, as waited over 2 months for first appointment"
"Access to Services","Probably the waiting time of 8 weeks did seem a long time to wait after the 1st assessment"
"Access to Services","A one to one consultation after finishing the 5 week course."
"Care/ Treatment","The only issue relates to anger ie consultant psychiatrist recommended CBT therapy as was only box I ticked on the  document in the psychiatrist's office after just 3 sessions. Let's talk have issue with this in that they didn't treat angry.  This has been brought up a few times during CBT."
"Involvement","I had no input, also did not have any idea what stress control sessions involved at my initial appointment.  At the appointment I was led to believe that other avenues of treatment would be available to me after this group, if required, however, at the last session we were all told that we would be discharged.  Apart from my first assessment, I have had no spoken contact with anyone.  I was given a lot of text book information but no opportunity to express my concerns, not helpful to patients with depression."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The opportunity to have some time at the end of each session to talk in small grouprs or on a one to one basis.  This would be confidential and not compulsory "
"Communication","To be able to phone for support every so often, but I realise this is not feasible."
"Access to Services","More money so more can benefit!!"
"Care/ Treatment","Possibly introducing real life situations for comparison.  "
"Access to Services","More therapists to shorten waiting lists to enable more people to access the thereapy."
"Access to Services","The sessions I have had have been very helpful but I have been cut short due to now receiving family counselling from a nother source. I would have liked to chave carried on as my personal issues are not going to be addressed in my family counselling."
"Communication","More information between therapist and patient is needed Note from BM: Q7 was completed by patient as N/A"
"Access to Services","Would like more sessions please"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I feel I would of been better with more face to face appointments as I would of been more motivated to turn up to sessions"
"Access to Services","The time from being referred by my GP to seeing a therapist was a long wait, unsure of the exact time but took a few months."
"Access to Services","Being ex NHS I know all treatment outcomes depend on funding and waiting lists, but starting therapy as early as possible is essential.  By the time my appointment came my situation had improved and I really needed to be seen at the critical time."
"Communication","'Email address rather than just calling the main office, would help, as some people might find this easier (as far as not always being able to call). "
"Access to Services","My Counsellor was excellent and really helped me.  I just felt 6 sessions are not sufficient when the amoun tof trauma I had experienced and the difficult time I was having.  I have a slight extension, but I feel there is a lot of my trauma I haven't even spoken about that I feel I really need to.  I knew Isobella did all she could in the time she was allowed and Im hugely grateful for her help.  I just feel it unfair to have the time/session constraints."
"Access to Services","Slightly longer period for the sessions.  6 weeks went too quickly.  Maybe a phased period before the last session eg drop to fortnightly then one follow up after a month."
"Access to Services","To have more sessions"
"Access to Services","Allowing the therapist and client to negotiate number of sessions. Flexibility in terms of the number of sessions required."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I didn't feel it tackled the personal issues I was going through."
"Access to Services","A longer extension of therapy if required, is the only possible improvement I can think of."
"Communication","More information, possibly reading material"
"Access to Services","Cut down waiting list."
"Access to Services","Longer therapy. Not long enough to work with the therapist need a lot more sessions to achieve some of the results. I have sever anxiety and depression as well as OCD, therefore will need a lot more sessions to address other mental health problems I have. Lata is also a trained mental health nurse as she is talking to me about using the medication I am on in a positive way. Been on medication for 33 years so reducing it is very hard for me. My GP is glad I have got Lata because she is a trained mental health nurse and this is beneficial for me."
"Communication","I felt listened to but an explaination of alternative theropies might have been explained more before starting treatment."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","MORE FACE TO FACE TIME APPOINTMENTS INSTED OF TELEPHONE APPOINTMETNS DURING THE FIRST STAGES OF TREATMENT"
"Communication","I found completing the modules quite hard work and required a high level of commitment and ""stickability"".  Sometimes, just being able to talk things through and get someone elses 'take' on the situation would be helpful.  One you are anxious it is often difficult to see the wood for the trees.  It is not easy to find or see the root cause of the anxiety yourself.  Many thanks to Laira a lively lady!"
"Access to Services","A little longer appointments as people have lots of things to say+feel they are on a time limit. "
"Communication","Fewer forms to fill in"
"Access to Services","More options for 9 - 5 workers to see someone"
"Access to Services","Would have been better to have to wait for less time, but was told how long it woul be so that helped, it wa the time they said. Communication was good however."
"Access to Services","I had to wait for an assessment and when I turned up to the appointment (10 miles away) I found the worker was off sick.  I then had a further wait for an appointment.  The assessment was useful but it took almost 2 months until I started the course and I was not offered CBT or anything else.  "
"Communication","When attending an appointment, not to be asked what do you think the service can do for me. At this stage how could I know this"
"Care/ Treatment","I think being able to go to group therapy and do 1 to 1 therapy alongside each other would have been very useful rather than doing them seperately.  I found the amount of ""homework"" was a little overwhelming as having a one year old son and my partner working away means I have little spare time. "
"Access to Services","would have liked less waiting time for intervention."
"Access to Services","Less waiting time between referral and having first appointment.  Facilities available to look after children whilst in appointments. Did not always have a babysitter available. Instead I had phone consultations but face to face consultations is much better."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I found it to be a very positive experience. Only change would be to offer more face to face contact."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","It has helped me to change my life - where i live and work. Also learned about my part in my anxiety and avoiding people. It was good that I could be seen in my lunch hour too."
"Access to Services","Reduce waiting time to start receiving help"
"Access to Services","I think that, in my experience, a much earlie appointment "
"Access to Services","Maybe if I could have seen someone earlier"
"Access to Services","I was told I would have to wait for level 3 treatment so should go on to level 2. This was after waiting for a long time for any response. I expressed I would prefer counselling but was told to try the level 2 anyway. After experiencing the level 2 I still felt I needed the level 3 counselling so was tranferred. "
"Access to Services","I felt, that 2 one to one sessions with a Psychologist was insufficient, for most of the time is taken up by box ticking by the Psychologis, time is needed to build up a relationship of understanding and experience - then I was informed that the sessions were by telephone. As a professional person, i feel insufficient time given to trusting relationships being forced which would lead to more "" patient participations"" is a positive manner."
"Access to Services","I feel I would have benefited sooner had I not had to wait so long for an appointment.  From doing my first assessment to my first appointment was too long and I could feel myself getting worse."
"Access to Services","May be shorter waiting time. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The stress management course I attended was a good idea as a starting point for myself, however I feel that 1-2-1 sessions would be more use as I cannot talk to family members about my problems.  So putting certain factors into practice is going well but need more talking time"
"Access to Services","Only getting the first appointment quicker after assessment. The information session I attended I felt was a waste of time as I had already been assessed and decided what counselling route I was taking. It felt like 2 people just talking at the group of people."
"Care/ Treatment","The parameters of the service are set up wrong.  I am fitting into your system instead of your system fitting my needs.  I feel I am only half way to being cured."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I feel that once you have spoken to your GP and then to a person who assesses your need, and then wait, it is difficult to continue 'openning up' to yet another person/therapist.  My counsellor was an excellent listener but more challenge would have been helpful.  Choices were offered but how can you really understand the choices available. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","HAVENT HAD ESPERIENCE OF 1 TO 1. FEEL THIS MAY HELP AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE"
"Access to Services","Would like more sesions and straight into follow up"
"Access to Services","Only wish I could have more"
"Access to Services","To extend sessions if necessary"
"Communication","I was offered stress control but i didn't realised i had a choice. the person I saw went into details and explaied the different options but then chose for me, she did not ask my opinion. Im not sure what the next option is if I want further support ie CBT. I would of liked someone to call me up as a follow up to see if i felt I needed more support . A leaflet expalining the diferent options/stages of support would be good."
"Access to Services","Lower waiting times"
"Environment/Facilities","Byron House - on fridays there is no receptionist and I feel they need someone there as patients that are mentally unwell might need some assistance asap.   *Client did report on one occasion that she was sitting opposite a distressed and unwell patient who thought they were being poisioned - the client stated that she felt uncomfortable in this situation"
"Access to Services","I had to wait months for treatment, in which time, my condition became worse.  I was told about all the options initially, but these need to be mentioned again.  I am lonely and isolated two weeks between sessions I feel is too long."
"Access to Services","Quuicker times waiting list"
"Involvement","4.  Was offered a choice of venue on day to suit me. 6.  But no classes running at the moment. 7.  Was invited to CBT - didnt know till had 1st appointment - thought I was having one to one counselling 8.  Was sent letter to make appointment and informed on 1st appointment what treatment I was getting. 9.  Was asked if it was ok to go with CBT and asked if things were ok. 11.  I did not understand that the help with stress would be CBT, thought I was going to see counsellor to talk to.  I was infiormed at 2nd appointment that the next appointments would be over the phone to see how I was doing and using the tools (ie CD relaxation and booklet regarding managing stress).  Personally, I do not think advising over phone is right.  An advisor is not able to really see how you are and you could say anything, probably what you think they want to hear.  The experience and information did reaffirm things I knew to help with stress and I am going ahead with the techniques.  I would like to say Chloe was a very pleasant and helpful - no problem with her."
"Care/ Treatment","It would have been useful to have gone to a group therapy session to meet other people and discuss problems and the situations we are dealing with.  An evening group would have been good . "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have preferred face to face, but the telephone work went better then I thought. "
"Access to Services","I think it may have helped if my GP could have referred me sooner.  I have felt anxious virtually every day since January.  Perhaps the GP could refer straight to this course and then if you felt you needed further help you could ask"
"Access to Services","It could be useful to have the option of a double session.  I was often conscious of the need to finish the session and even kept my emotions in check close to the end of a session. At the start of treatment there was a problem with chagning venues.  the one changed to Ollerton was not clear that there could be confusion between two possible buildings. Questions 2 and 6 were answered ""sorry can't remember"". Question 12.  Patient sais it was likely that he would recommend the service to a family member of friend."
"Access to Services","Sessions could last longer than just 6 or so appointments - But overall treatment and surroundings was nice and pleasant"
"Access to Services","Deal with issues sooner.  My stress related illness could have got much worse in the time it took to be contacted."
"Access to Services","Could have done with more sessions for support through difficult personal situation"
"Access to Services","More in depth sessions like there is.  Probably for a longer period of time for 6 weeks or so."
"Access to Services","Less waiting time, however, for me the timing in my crisis situation was appropriate.  feedom to be seen again.  "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time especially feeling how I was. "
"Access to Services","Less waiting time.  I had to wait 6 months! Choice of therapist.  A follow up if wanted."
"Access to Services","Would like more than 6 sessions"
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to do some group work regarding what is helping "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would rather have one to one counselling"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To have one to one alongside the course"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Offer of one to one sessions at end to look at specific issues for the individual to see how they can action plan and get it right"
"Care/ Treatment","The first session with 30-40 people felt very impersonal and of limited help. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time. "
"Access to Services","More sessions for each course"
"Access to Services","It took approx 3 months to get the first appointment from the initial referral from my GP six weeks to even get an assessment appointment. Under my personal circumstance it would have been more beneficial to have seen someone sooner, when it was really needed."
"Access to Services","When a patient has deep issues I feel that 6 or 8 sessions isnt long enough and doesnt always touch the surface of the problems.  Going away from the last sesion of therapy is very upsetting when there are so many issues that need addressing."
"Access to Services","Could make the waiting time less"
"Access to Services","I couldnt give 24 hours notice I was late cancelling an appointment due to a serious unavaoidable matter which resulted in a session being removed.  I think discretion of the therapist should be used as to whether this is to be taken away or not.  I have had a difficult time caring for a relative and her care came first on this day.  I really could have used that extra session, especially as my therapist understood my plight and was very sorry the rules are such as this."
"Access to Services","Not quite so long to to wait initially and to be more informed what was happening during the wait.Service excellent with therpaist.After care perhaps a followup telephone call to keep up morale."
"Access to Services","More than the 6 sessions that are currently available. Thank you very much for the ser vice you have given me, I feel it has really helped me by talking about my problems."
"Access to Services","More sessions"
"Access to Services","Waiting time was too long i.e. 6 months, half that time would have been manageable. I have had a very fulfilling life experience of learning."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time.  Initial assessment with same therapist as ongoing treatment.  Requested female but initially offered a male."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was initially referred for counselling 2010 ! and due to huge errors I was placed into wrong catageries, increasing my MH and causing extreme distress.  After a complaint I was eventually seen by a psychiatrist, who advised me (incorrectly whom to contact)  After much web searching I found 'Lets Talk ' from there it seemed agess until contact, and ages to an appt considering my history I was surprised at the time delay. The counsellor herself was very nice, hoever, due to stupidly of preselling 6 weeks only regardless of presenting conditions,  I have become more anxious and have reverted to my suicidal tendancies as all it did was open up raw wounds, but not close them; as she had indifferent time. (writing difficult to read)"
"Access to Services","Waiting time too long"
"Access to Services","Needs to be more sessions and long time in each sessions."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times, I thought I had been forgotten"
"Access to Services","More sessions"
"Access to Services","I felt that the waiting time for getting on the first meeting was too long.  When someone feels so desperate and suicidal there needs to be quick access to services, as I know from losing a friend in this way."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The success of this treatment very much depends on the personality and character of both the patient and therapist.  The first therapist I saw at Nottingham City Hospital was not a good experience and I felt very unable to communicate comfortably with her,  I was then sent another appointment and started seeing the therapist at Torkard Hill MC she was wonderful and I felt I benefitted tremendously from seeing her.  not having a good experience the first time could deter patients from accessing further treatment, unable to see how this can be resolved,  I was lucky i tried a second time."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Would recommend service As I was unable to use women's aid services due to locationand ex-partner it would have been helpful if women abuse victims were prioritised if women's aid support services are not an option more nearer to the time of the incident etc. self referral via doctor was lengthy."
"Care/ Treatment","Service was very good, but possible exploration of alternative therapy type not offered. CBT and generic counselling seem well established but possible more types of therapy could be offered/funded. Could possibly have received more information just the counselling which could have been offerd. Very happy with therapist and CBT though."
"Communication","I really feel it is important for the initial assessment to be one to one and not over the phone. I felt the telephone assessment assessor was ticking boxes on a database rather than listening properly. I was very honest and was worried I had been experiencing mood swings either due to my post ovary operation and HRT or psychological problems from a very difficult few years. They immediately referred me to social services as I once smacked my daughter. Had I not been of sound mind I would have probably killed myself as I thought my children were going to be taken away. I felt that my honesty was being punished and the concern was no longer for me and that I had no one this was very dangerous. Having spoken to social services all was fine but this should have been done differently."
"Care/ Treatment","I worked as a therapist for many years - had my own practice in a top private hospital in London.  Also worked in prisons with sserious cases.  I think some of what you ask is too ""black or white"".  What about the shades of grey!!!  Each person will have their own experience which is unique to them.  What do you expect to gain from the various forms ""Yes or no"".  We are talking about feelins and emotions, these cant be boxed and tidied up!  "
"Access to Services","For me something 'on-going' as a 'safety blanket'/ first to stop me feeling vulnerable, although I do realise, it cannot go on forever.  Sometimes I felt as though I needed someone I knew on the end of the phone. "
"Access to Services","slow start"
"Access to Services","I am aware that now you have no waiing times. Unfortunately I had a very long period to wait and I think it is important to keep waiting periods to the minimum. The NHS helpline I personally think was no help and often made me feel stressed at times."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Been generally satisfied but it's not the right time for me due to feeling physically unwell"
"Access to Services","A follow up within 3-6 months would be benefical. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Very difficult to fill this in as have not had any 1-2-1 therapy support"
"Communication","Prior to treatment, maybe an idea of how long you would need to wait would alleviate some anxieties"
"Communication","Perhaps more variety in topics throughout the course instead of always using powerpoint style delivery"
"Access to Services","Maybe offer to bring a close friend along? I have a let of friend who were interested when I spoke about the course. "
"Communication","I think the therapists that run the course should be given the opportunity to do presentation training, time to practice and sub notes to promt and speak to. At times it felt like just reading from slides. However, it has still been very usefull."
"Access to Services","The only think that I would suggest is a reduction in the time taken for the first appointment after GP referral.  If the reduction is not possible then perhaps a little more communication to both the patient and the GP to explain the delay.  As an aside; I would like to suggest the introduction of a mobile-Landline text facility.  This would allow client to text the office should they need to do so, for instance when they have no call-time credit on their mobile."
"Access to Services","I feel as if I would have benefited more if my sessions had been at the same time on the same day every week."
"Communication","They were supposed to be sorting me out a counsellor also but still no word.  I feel that the stress control meetings didnt work."
"Access to Services","Although I understand about waiting times, having to wait over  8 months for sessions meant that things became very bad - it could have been easier to sort out if I had them sooner."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Telephone talking was good but more face to face interaction is probably better. "
"Access to Services","Wait for initial appointment was very long. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The last lecture. I know why I can't sleep. The lecture told me nothing new."
"Access to Services","Although we extended my time from 6 to 8 sessions it has not been long enough to explore the issues properly. I was under the impression it would be for longer. This was what my GP wanted too. I need to re-refer to be able to move on with the most important issues. Patient highlighted her answers on the sheet: Q1 ticked dissatisfied stating ""but understood the situation""  and satisfied. Q3 ""need more time"". Q6 ""? cant remember ,don't think so"". Q9 ""?"". Q10 ticked dissatisfied ""need more time = .... problem"", and satisfied ""as I understand the situation"""
"Access to Services","Quicker referral system to cut down on waiting time where help is very much needed. No limit on sessions- it's a countdown that causes more anxiety and stress."
"Access to Services","Was a long wait for my initial appointment. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I cannot recall being given a diagnosis other than CBT would help. I believed I was depressed and stressed but no help was offered for depression."
"Access to Services","No horrible waits and less patronising literature"
"Communication","I was happy with my therapist but answering your form it brought to my attention that there were other forms of treatment (q4 & 6) and it would of been nice to have been informed."
"Access to Services","No actual end date. I would have liked to have been seen at regular intervals for longer."
"Communication","Waiting time was too long."
"Access to Services","I received no communication between my mutual consultation and starting the course. This was 13 weeks wait. I thought why was happy and had given up hope of contact or help. You should send a letter after the consultation to confirm what is happening."
"Involvement","Give us a choice. More information about manic behaviours. More information on CBT and support sites onlineon the hand outs please"
"Access to Services","Earlier consultation and treatment More sessions"
"Access to Services","Less waiting time"
"Access to Services","Although I opted for telephone consultation, Nottingham city would have been inconvenient for north nottinghamshire residents"
"Access to Services","Counselling has helped me a lot and Isabella was greatand responded to everything I struggled with. My only complaint is the amount of time I had to wait before seeing someone."
"Access to Services","Six sessions is ok for some but not for myself with a longer term painful event to deal with. Sessions, should change depending on circumstances (number of sessions)"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would have preferred to have spoken to somebody face to face on the first initial contact with the service.  I think it would have been easier to talk and discuss different options appropriate to my needs"
"Access to Services","Initial problems were encountered April-June last year. I really could have done with this support back then. There were some delays in seeing Cherie but they were not her fault and resolved by her seeing me at home."
"Access to Services","I did have to call several times in the begining to get an appointment, however once I had been allocated a therapist things moved very quickly. I was grateful for the extra sessions."
"Access to Services","Had to wait a long time to be seen."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would like to have 1:1 appointments to help me understand and move on from my past."
"Access to Services","After my first session I was sent straight to stress control, but I would have prefered a ferw more one to one sessions as well as the course.  So I was a bit dissappointed that I was seen for 1/2 an hour then put in a group.  I think I perhaps needed someone with me a bit more initially"
"Communication","Have a patient intranet so all materials were available whenever needed even when sessions are over. "
"Access to Services","I was disatisfied with having to wait 6 months,however, I do feel that if I had have received treatment earlier I would have needed further treatment later on"
"Care/ Treatment","Every week seemed extremely repetitive, feel like it focused too much on the symptoms of anxiety which I found frustrating as i know my symptoms but still dont know how to prevent them."
"Access to Services","Help people like me with drink problems.  We still need this help"
"Access to Services","Had to wait along time for the therapy but satisfied when received."
"Access to Services","I am very disappointed at the length of time I have had to wait to receive counselling. I am still waiting to hear. Although the course has helped, I still feel I need Counselling. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would have preferred face to face counselling. I feel I would have benefited from counselling over a longer period of time."
"Care/ Treatment","I liked the idea of phone call appointments and being in my home"
"Access to Services","Need a lot of work, 6 week course is not really enough, need to talk over my issues and problems."
"Access to Services","I feel it took a long time to wait for first appointment in my case it would have be more benefiting to have less waiting time."
"Access to Services","Would have found more sessions helpful. "
"Access to Services","I would like to be able to continue seeing Janice after course ends, say every six months rather than feeling abandoned after six sessions"
"Access to Services","Only the waiting time is bad, the pressure of waiting so long only makes your situation worse."
"Access to Services","Given plenty of opportunity to talk about my life in general and what is happening but didn't seem to have enough time to build enough confidence to talk about early issues in my life that ultimatley led me to seek counselling."
"Communication","It took me by surprise that it was over the phone, I cant remember being told but I may of been. "
"Access to Services","(I would of liked a counsellor of the same beliefs as mine) The first ever appointment where you go to see what treatment path to take is disappointing - I was put on a timer and told I had 20 mins to talk then at the end I was told I had OCD. I was discusted at firstly being hurried through a dawting interview where they had my life in their hands which I had to trust. I thought the outcome they made was correct however I felt like Un-Human being told I have a time limit and not much time and then at the end crash bang - you have OCD. Please correct this form of counselling its wrong. I think more time is needed."
"Communication","The Form (Routine Measures) could be worded better to make it more clear to allow better understanding of what is being asked"
"Access to Services","It is just the length of time you have to wait for first appointment.  "
"Care/ Treatment","I woud welcome the option of recieving an alternative therapy e.g.  CBT that may help me with my sleeping problems. I am actually not familiar with what possible alternative therapies are available and would be interested to know if any would help and if I would be considered eligable for them/it. "
"Access to Services","waiting time for first appointment could be sooner. "
"Access to Services","Waiting to be seen not so good."
"Communication","Once I was refered by the GP before I had the screening.  I found the 14 day letter a little bit strong seeing as I was feeling so, A phone call would of been nice, as the letter wasnt very incouraging.  It has been very helpful, the tools I have gained have been very helpful.  "
"Access to Services","I had to wait a lot time to see someone when I was feeling at my worse. Innitially I felt 30 mintues wasnt very long, It felt quiet rushed sometimes.  "
"Access to Services","I would have preferred to continue my therapy visiting my therapist and not by telephone"
"Involvement","Would have liked a little bit more time to make a decision on the type of treatment offered.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt uncomfortable about the therapist who conducted my assessment.  She jumped to wrong conclusions and I requested someone else.  "
"Access to Services","More sessions, more time, coordinated follow up. "
"Environment/Facilities","from my viewpoint the only improvement could be transport so my husband doesn't have to wait for me each time. But that would take money away from helping people with councillors "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It would be good to be able to have 1:1 sessions in conjunction with this course.  I Supplemented with a  counsellor felt once started this should continue as helpful."
"Access to Services","If I could have had this help earlier it certainly wouldn'thave been such a long job for me to feel better. Overall the helpi had was very beneficial for me."
"Access to Services","Possible Ad-hoc access when in crisis.  Telephone access to Counsellor."
"Access to Services","More funding to quicker access and longer treatment. I had 12 sessions, my therapist was fantastic and helped me more than I thought possible but a few back-up sessions, possibly a month or 2 after would be beneficial maybe in the form of a review. Thank you."
"Care/ Treatment","Why we have these problems and understanding them - More Group opitions - meeting other people with the same illnesses."
"Access to Services","Would have been good to be seen more quickly from the screening assessment I had."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","One problem I have had is speaking on the phone. Im not the biggest fan on phones.  I dont always say what I mean or muddle up my words. Although it didnt seem to affect how well I did."
"Communication","My initial experience pre xmas 2012 was very poor.  I felt very unable to communicate this to my therapist at the time.  Meetings were spaced too far apart and often left me further confused due to digression of conversation in the meetings.  I gladly stopped attending sessions."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Innitially the telephone appointments I didint find as helpful as face to face, I liked social interaction.  But my concerns were deminished and I liked this as it was convenient."
"Access to Services","Waiting time to talk and needed to be listened too."
"Access to Services","I did not feel there were enough sessions available."
"Access to Services","Improvement in initial waiting time. "
"Care/ Treatment","The first session (Screening Clinic), I found it uncomftable facing things, as it went over the same questions. "
"Access to Services","I still need more sessions or something. i will return once i have settled "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I feel I learn more being interactive and that is why I would like 1-1. "
"Access to Services","A permanent base for my therapist would be a good thing.  Other than that, I do not think the service could be improved."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I have always prefered to face to face appontments, I think it would of helped me quicker."
"Access to Services","The course could be over four weeks and longer sessions.  There could be more time to stay and talk after.  However the course itself its very, very informative and useful."
"Access to Services","LONGER TREATMENT PERIOD"
"Communication","The initial form filling in, too repetative for weekly sessions and in my case I felt it was useless. Felt the telephone interviews not as helpful as a result. Overall I do feel better equipped to cope with my worry & anxiety."
"Communication","Did not feel this form is applicable to group presentation. "
"Involvement","Was placed on stress management, although doctor originally referred me for post traumatic stress disorder,  believing that a counsellor (1:1) would be of benefit.  The stress course has been helpful, but still need counselling"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More session with same therapist -she really seemed to 'get me' . Also so I dont have to tell my story all over again"
"Environment/Facilities","The chairs"
"Access to Services","Increase in length of time, more sessions.  Clients would have more time to adjust to sessions and have a wind down period before being sent back into society alone.  I will say I had doubts about counselling but Teresa has been excellent.l  I will miss the sessions."
"Access to Services","I feel thaqt 6 sessions may not be enough, particularly in the early stages of therapy.  I have had 18 sessions over 2 years and, in the early stages, more would have been beneficial.  Reduced waiting time! "
"Access to Services","Had to wait for months for treatment could begin.  I felt it was too long.  "
"Communication","More information on therapies available"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Keep up the good work,and get more staff!"
"Access to Services","Length of time from intial first phone call to time of therapy was a long time, but i was told this on the phone call that it could be several months   "
"Environment/Facilities","The seating is not suited t people with back/neck problems."
"Access to Services","As my circumstances changed during the time of my treatment I would have liked the number of sessions to be extended. I am aware that a set number has been recommended as part of the treatment - to meet agreed deadlines and goals. I want to be able to stay in contact as I feel I need to be supported during periods of low self esteem and mood. I have been happy with the help I have received and guidance to identify triggers to my low mood."
"Access to Services","time from GP refferal for first appointment (inital assessment) was longer than ideal.  Introdcution of diary sheet could have been earlier in therapy."
"Access to Services","If the therapist was avaialble in my area more than 1 day per week and not just Fridays"
"Access to Services","I think the waiting for your appointment can be quite a wait."
"Access to Services","There were problems in waiting from December to actually being in treatment."
"Communication","May be a bit more contact from the service whilst waiting for the first appointment to explain reasons for the wait. Everything else was good and very helpful"
"Communication","I feel the service leans hevily towards box ticking and form completion, the treatment I received from the practitioner was well balances and progressive, but this need to complete the form and tick the appropriate boxes seemed to take priority.  I know that form completion is a necessary evil, but I feel it should take second place to the actual treatment."
"Communication","At 1st meeting didn't realise I couldn't take my daughter as I didn't have a letter so felt uncomfortable when I was told I shouldn't have her with me. I thought I wouldn't want to go to the appointments. "
"Access to Services","When you are so low to have to keep phoning to see when you are to get an appointment is sole destroying.  It makes you feel as though you are a nagger - more could be done to minimise the long wait either by an update of where one is within the pecking order - I feel I could still be on the waiting list had I not kept asking various agencies.  The 'treatment meetings' are not in question, having to wait over 6 months is not acceptable - I did not want anti-depressants or other pills - sleeping etc.  Surely talking therapy is much healthier and gives people other ways of thinking outside the box and realising the emotions are quite normal to go through not feeling like a freak."
"Access to Services","I was very, very down and at a less in December/January when this course  would have been needed - got on course in July"
"Access to Services","You get help from the service but have got to help youreself."
"Access to Services","Taken too long to get on course. Needed course when my depression was getting worse"
"Environment/Facilities","My only problem I found was the room was small without a window which made me feel closed in at times."
"Care/ Treatment","When I was initially referred to the service and after my assessment, I had to attend a Stress Control before I could receive 1:1 counselling. Whilst quite interesting, I didn't find this couse to be relevant. As it was non-participative I found it to be too general and the two ladies just read from an OHP slideshow which was quiet boring. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Sometimes it would have helped to speak to someone face to face. i understand this is difficult because an appointment structure has to be in place. but there are times when you need to speak to someone. "
"Access to Services","Waiting times need to be improved from initial referral. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Although my therapist was very good I would of prefered my treatment face to face, I found phone calls very inpersonal."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Personally I dont like telephone work appointments, I felt I connected better face to face, that I couldnt be honest on the phone, so did not find it helpful"
"Access to Services","I understand that waiting times for starting have improved"
"Access to Services","I live in Lowdham - would have liked somewhere closer to see therapist as I had a 40 mile round trip. For some people it may put them off using the Service in terms of anxiety it may raise and financial costs in travelling to the venue. "
"Access to Services","To be seen in a much quicker time between initial assessment and starting treatment I believe I had about a three month wait.  This is far too long when you are posssibly needing treatment straight away.  Also for some people it is a big step to ask for help and a long wait means it is even more difficult"
"Communication","Online appointment booking/cancelled for both therapists"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Having completed a general anxiety evening class, I was then assessed for more 1:1 therapy for social anxiety. I was disappointed to be told the 1:1 would be in fact a 30 min telephone call. To me this wasn't ideal in the sense that it reduced opportunity for interaction and exposure to social interaction. Aside from that, I am satisfied with service and therapist."
"Communication","I found filling in measures every week irritating and not necessarily relevant."
"Access to Services","Being able to continue the treatment for longer"
"Access to Services","Weekly assessment form Speed of how quickly treatment is received"
"Access to Services","I wished I had received counselling earlier when required instead of being placed on a six week stress course. "
"Access to Services","I did ask for a female counsellor. re you offered choice of therapist,I was not happy that it took 5 months from referral to first appointment - but then mine was not exactly an emergency case! Thank you Ruby for helping me."
"Access to Services","Not to have a finite number of sessions - as there is a sense of ""bereftness"" thaat there will no longer ba any contact with your therapist after 12 sessions."
"Access to Services","I hope that they don't make Government cuts so that people who need this can get it."
"Access to Services","Even though I know resources are strained, if at all possible, an extension programme would be really helpful so that patients could continue having occasional sessions even if they were less regular.  I know I would certainly have benefitted from some follow-up sessions."
"Communication","Too much every day form filling on the hour, very irrtating.  Have other things to think about.  Only discussed what the filled form says and how to improve my wellbeing.  I know what is needed to improve my wellbeing, not to discuss it all the time from a form."
"Access to Services","I was sent on a CBT course in West Bridgford which wasn't  very convenientas I don't drive but my husband was able to take me. This was then stopped after two weeks due to lack of numbers. "
"Access to Services","Only improvement would have liked longer with the therapist maybe an hour instead of half an hour"
"Access to Services","Q4.  Assigned one, she was lovely.  A return appointment for a few months later to check on you.  Fab service, been a great help."
"Care/ Treatment","By the time the sessions began I had already begun to make/ do things myself with help of family - I wanted cousnelling of which I found very difficult and my therapist didnt get to the root of it thats why I discontinued as I only had 3 sessions left, the fact that I can deal/cope with this and carry on my normal day to day activities I think puts you at the 'shes alright' very disappointed that there was no evening sessions so I was using my lunch hour - useful!NOT Just thought how disappoited I was the the service and I wouldnt recommend - I'd recommend private counselling sessions - where you really matter"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would like a one to one therapy psychologist to help with personal issues. I find this course very rushed and condensed to suit time availabilities. Was no time for questions"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Would have liked a one to one"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The lady I saw at Ashfield Community Hospital made me feel very uncomfortalbe and forced me to talk and explain things which really upset me. "
"Access to Services","For me I think I would have liked to access counselling also."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","More support with specific problems like getting back to work or dealing with employers. More meetings with family members in attendance"
"Access to Services","Took nearly a year from referral to being seen for the first time. However, the counselling has been excellent and worth the wait."
"Access to Services","I waited over a year for my first appointment. "
"Access to Services"," I believe my depression would have not been as bad nor gone on for so long, had I had to access to counselling far earlier instead of having to wait nearly a year."
"Access to Services","I do feel that the initial time taken to actually be assessed is very insufficient. "
"Access to Services","Longer sessions would be better. My confidence has got better. Strategies discussed were helpful and something I can go, keep and access back to."
"Access to Services","Very slow from initial phone call to first appointment this could be improved or communicated better."
"Access to Services","Dissatisfied with time to wait for first treatment - only because there was an error made and I was marked as 'case closed' "
"Communication","The graphs which were sent to me did not easily identify the subject matter.  Additionally I was unable to interpret the scores thereon.  i must ssay I have found the thersapy very helpful thanks to Janice and much appreciated.."
"Care/ Treatment","Attended all sessions I did not need a powerpoint presentation read to me - I can do this at home Pace too slow. Too much tome filling in Too many different staff"
"Communication","I would encourage admin staff to send acknowledgement of emails."
"Access to Services","The  impression gained is that it is very easy to ""fall off the list"" whilst waiting for first appointment, all letters seem to say "" if you do not do x  we will discharge you"". I understand the pressures but it leaves one nervous about not  in the correct way, it does not convey a caring approach. There are many reasons to do with even a mild condition that a patient might not respond in a timely manner other than just being dilatory."
"Access to Services","Great service, but 4 months wait not good, not sure if it worked"
"Access to Services","I think the number of sessions could be extended beyond 6. I understand cash is an issue but this would have helped."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The original assessment was very disappointing.  I was accused of using the service to back up my position against my employment.  I nearly walked out in the first 15 mins. Q12.  Patient would be 'likely' to recommend the service to a family member or friend."
"Access to Services","Wish I could have been seen quicker. But it has been helpful"
"Access to Services","unfortunately the whole process of getting an appointment of initial contact was extremely slow.  I felt I had no help, and was feeling exteremely ill with anxiety and depression.  I reached an extreme low. Luckily I managed to turner a corner by myself and was helped by my therapist. Linda White helped me enorously and I cant thank her enough. I just wish the therapy would have taken less time as at the time I needed immediate help."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times, people are sometimes desperate for help."
"Access to Services","Very unhappy about the 4 months wait for treatment my personal situation had changed. had to find my own help online advice from the GP really helped had hoped to get that help that from Lets talk wellbeing. The treatment providing would benefit from face to face rather than telephone. I felt uncomfortable doing it on the phone. communication is not just vocal would like to see no-verbal. lack of face to face work was the biggest disappointment. "
"Access to Services","Disappointed with the long wait and felt forgotten. Counselling (Ruby) made me think/see things differentlyto how I was thinking and the strategies motivated me to the change I required. I feel more confident and self esteem much improved."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time. Counselling helped me to look at how I can look at myself. It has given me the courage to look at things, I did not want to look at. It is extremely likely that I would recommend service to friends and family"
"Access to Services","From my perspective the only improvement would be reduced waiting times."
"Environment/Facilities","I found the total quiet when entering the first couple of weeks very daunting in the first couple of weeks, and I'm sorry but the relaxation CD makes me laugh!"
"Access to Services","Would recommend the service, although there should be more sessions avaliable."
"Access to Services","Very good service, needs to be more sessions available"
"Access to Services","Quicker first appointment so I'd know that I'd be getting help and how long I would have to wait."
"Communication","My experience of admin. from the outset has been a catalogue of errors on their part and they did not keep me informed of the process."
"Access to Services","For myself, the waiting time worked out well.  However, for other clients, the wait would probably have been far too long.  Q12.  The patient indicated that it would be extremely likely that she would recommend the service to a family member or friend."
"Access to Services","A greater number of sessions would be valuable.   The patient indicated that it would be extremely likely that he would recommend the service to a family member or friend."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Initial assessment - was very nervous found the therapist very dismissive (i.e. it was like she was saying I did not have a problem but she would refer me for treatment anyway). This made me think that it was all in my head and it made me feel that therapy seemed like a waste of time. The assessor did not inspire me with confidence and I left feeling so bad that I had to walk for 2 hours to get my head around my experience of the assessment. It made me not want to go for treatment as I thought if it is like the assessment what is the point. I was therefore very apprehensive re: going for treatment. My experience of therapy was very successfully and everyone has noticed the changes in me since having treatment. Reegarding reccommending to a friend or family member I would say likeliish as it very much depends on the therapist you get. I now feel genuienely happy as opposesd to pretending I was happy. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The person who I saw re: my first assessment made me feel like a nuisance - she was matter of fact re: her approach."
"Access to Services","Would have benefitted from a shorter waiting time"
"Access to Services","Found the time scale from my initial assessment to recieving IPT disappointing as at initial appt was told the waiting time would be a couple of weeks when it was nearer to 5 months Not sure if 8 sessions is enough to get to a resolution or if fortnightly appts might be better for some people It would be likely that I would recommend this service to a friend or family memeber "
"Communication","CBT was really beneficial and will help me long term. I think it would have helped me if I had been sent a bit more information on CBT prior to my sessions."
"Access to Services","It was too long waiting for CBT therapy as I was told to see CBT therapy as I waited for over 3 months which seems too long as had problem with our marriage as well.  Aslo sam deaf too I was much appreciated that there wwere |BSL interpreter provided also deaf awareness Big thanks again."
"Care/ Treatment","More flexibility outside of working hours. I have been at work full time for the duration of therapy. It can be hard to get time off work to attend sessions which puts you under more pressure."
"Access to Services","The time taken between initial referral and course start does seem long to wait - approx 8-12 weeks I think in my instance. In addition if some interaction can be included in the course - discussion amongst the group etc then would have added value. The course content is good and useful/ helpful and facilitators were approachable/ understanding and professional. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time."
"Access to Services","i feel that 6 session is not adequate enough for bereavement"
"Access to Services","Would recommend to friend and family More sessions given until you feel you don't need them anymore as, with my depression,, is up and down all the time. Notr from BM: Sessions were extended by two and patient does feel much better. "
"Access to Services","Offering further sessions without the need of a re-referral from GP. 6-8 sessions is a little limited when further support required If only once a month."
"Communication","The webpage was not as clear as it could be and it was confusing at times"
"Communication","Admin problem & referral problem VIA GP"
"Care/ Treatment","It would be helpful to have support workers that would be able to help with exposure experiments.  You need a set number of therapy sessions but also need a support worker who could help in between sessions with practice. New equipment would be helpful."
"Access to Services","Later evening appointments, otherwise my therapist was excellent"
"Communication","To be able to discuss health and medical problems"
"Access to Services","Change in venue, sitting in a room full of young mums and babies, does not help the state of mind "
"Access to Services","Waiting time to see a counsellor for treatment seems an eternity when you are felling desperate and needing help. Help is needed there and then and whilst I realise that immediate assistance is not possible, just knowing that help will be availble in the short term provides a measur of relief."
"Access to Services","The one thing I had a problem with was the wait, the time from seeing my GP to my first counseling session felt like a long time, I didn't receive any leaflets or support."
"Access to Services","I had to wait 6 months before being referred by my Gp, to when I had first appt. I was told it would be 6-8 weeks. I really needed it a lot sooner to help with my state of depression. I felt that 6 sessions wasn't enough to help properly. I wasn't really given any choice as to type of treatment, but I trusted the professional to recommend what I needed."
"Access to Services","More availability of the little CBT books."
"Communication","The way it is initially described could maybe be improved slightly, to better explain what it is and isnot, although that could have been my own preconceptions and misunderstandings"
"Care/ Treatment","Need push feel can't work alone so guided self help not directly for me. Someone else may enjoy it."
"Access to Services","More availability, easier access, phone service"
"Access to Services","Would have liked sessions for a longer amount of time"
"Access to Services","The only thing i think would help would be possibly have some people work on weekends as it can be difficult finding time during work hours to come."
"Access to Services","Possibly more sessions with my therapy. I was or really felt things were beginning to click towards the end. When a person has thought one way for 60 years, it's going to take more than 8 sessions to break habits and ways of thinking. To loose or leave coping mechanisms (old ways of managing the OCD), is like suffering a bereavement."
"Access to Services","Quicker/shorter time scale GP to first therapy session. For me GP refered in Jan, I started first session in June."
"Access to Services","Allowing courses to be extended on the needs and circumstances of the client."
"Access to Services","Waiting time to see therapist"
"Access to Services","The therapist that I had, Paul Ford, was a great help and very patient.  It would have been more helpful to have had the therapy earlier. I had to wait 6 months and by that time I was feeling much better. "
"Access to Services","I just think that if waiting times were reduced this would be a huge improvement. But overall I have found the sessions really useful and the therapist very easy to talk to and discuss things with."
"Access to Services","The six sessions are not enough for some people after those more should be available if therapist and patient wish to continue"
"Access to Services","Telephone work was not as expected, didn't find it as personal."
"Care/ Treatment","The therapy options  were not ideal and especially when youre at Crisis point.  I needed therapy immediately and had to wait 5 months. CRISIS means CRISIS !  Not - when we can get around to it. plus Cognitive Therapy is not ideal when you're CRISIS - the patient is not strong enough mentally to 'over-ride' a thinking pattern until the fear and anxiety/reason for it has been talked out."
"Access to Services","Extending the number of weeks therapy, as we are all different and have difefrent need.  I've been very pleased with the treatment but now it feels like that's it now get on with it."
"Access to Services","Thank you for letting me see Isabella It has helped me a lot and she is brilliant. The only thing was the wait."
"Record Keeping","The weekly form to fill in (routine psychological measures) became a burden."
"Access to Services","The time it takes to see a therapists need to be shorter"
"Access to Services","Would have liked a longer period of sessions- or a couple more in a month or so to see how I am progressing. But advised can rerefer if I feel necessary."
"Communication","After referral I had to ring up only to find I had been lost in the system! First therapist did not turn up to 2nd appointmant. Restarted with Paula Brocklehurst. The administration seemed poor. I didn't hear anything for weeks until I rang. 1st therapist decided she was not able to help me but no one informed me. Therefore I attended but no one turned up,"
"Care/ Treatment","Now on week 6 thinking I could have looked at other issues to get more out of it feel still lots of issues not addressed feel worse now than at start."
"Access to Services","No choice of venue I prefer Stapleford Health Centre which is only 15 minutes walk from my house and has better facilities access and safety. Beeston, where I went has a small meeting room accessible only by a narrow, rickety staircase and uneven floor in the corridor. Definitely not suitable as an NHS venue."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The second time I was assessed I felt patronised by the male assessor and thought he was dismissive of my problems and how he spoke to me. He seemed too laid back. I was dreading him being my therapist. I found Nicci and Veronica who treated me to be very supportive and helpful."
"Access to Services","There were issues around getting a date initially -I  was cancelled by and agency therapist and another appointment was arranged for a time when I was out of the country and i had to wait a while afetr this and it would have been good to have some contact in this time as i was concerned that I might have missed out. Since th CBT has started it has been great though!"
"Access to Services","Would have preferred a bit more time as 1-1 being given the opourtunity to talk to a counsellor about my problems i think may have resulted in me being more specific about my problems, the cause of it. This may have led to a different therapy solution. I find questionnaires and evaluations don't always enable me to say what i think and feel so inevitably I end up compromising my answers. Likely to recommend others"
"Communication","I found the sessions very helpful, but  I found the weekly measures form confusing, mainly the phobia and work & social adjustment scales.  I would recommend re-designing this form."
"Access to Services","Would like treatment to be longer. Help/support during the waiting period for appointment."
"Communication","More signposting to mindfulness classes."
"Access to Services","Once accepted not having to wait for first consultation."
"Care/ Treatment","Unlikely to recommend course"
"Access to Services","The wait times are long but understandable due to the volume of patients I believe. If these wait times could be reduced it would make a great service even better."
"Access to Services","Follow up with service, say yearly intervals "
"Care/ Treatment","I had some issues when waiting for initial telephone contact. The appointment did not happen and I had to ring the service. Another appointment was quickly arranged. After that the process was as quick as would be expected."
"Communication","I was told outright that my paperwork was shredded whilst moving offices, which made me wait longer for treatment. October I made the appointment; march 24th was my very first appointment. If it has been critical it would have been too late. As a result of this, I had two reasons why attending counselling, only had time for 1 of the subjects to be brought up. So more sessions for reasons"
"Access to Services","I had to wait 18 months to get therapy from lets talk which was very frusting. However i am very pleased with the experience and have made many positive steps in my life."
"Communication","I personally would have preferred not to repeat the section at the end of the weekly IAPT measures sheet - in particular 'have you ever attempted suicide in the past' It is a sensitive question and doesn't need repeating every week."
"Access to Services","only the time waiting I suffered a lot during the year I waited to be seen. but I am very happy with everything about how the service was offered: venue, location, timekeeping etc. The initial appointment letter said which nr to ring but not the office nr. "
"Access to Services","Reducing waiting time would help"
"Access to Services","Waiting times once referral made from GP and then a therapist was to long in my case. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting times, improved services for those with alcohol problems"
"Access to Services","Flexibility about the duration. i.e. 8 weeks."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Assigned one worker started with her then sadly she was unable to work. Waited a while to meet someone new and start process again. More funding to increase your staffing numbers and the number of poeple you could reach!"
"Environment/Facilities","Imaginal exposure - it would be helpful if a more comfortable chair or back rest be provided so the experience could not be distracted by discomfort."
"Access to Services","Nothing. It was fine as it was, the only thing I would suggest is to have a longer period of sessions or provide a number we have been speaking to, if the desperate need should arise. "
"Communication","At my first sit down the therapists English wasn't very good and if it isn't very good I thought if I had had to have her I would have to change it, though she was nice"
"Communication","Chloe Vardy was very supportive with the appointments, but I do feel that the phone call appointments would have been more personal if it was a face to face appointment as I did find it difficult with work committments to make an appouintment that was as convenient as it could have been.  The phone calls were still good though.  Thank you."
"Access to Services","You need more than 5 sessions u need time to get to know the person u are confiding into and telling ur deepest feelings to 5 is not enough to trust someone."
"Access to Services","Maybe a shorter waiting list"
"Access to Services","I needed to see someone sooner really"
"Access to Services","It would have been good to have been seen sooner. "
"Access to Services","Longer than 6 sessions, think about surroundings of reasons for need of sessions."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More therapists."
"Access to Services","I really found it helpful for me however if it was longer it might be better, but the length was ok. "
"Access to Services","Improvements - waiting times, more staff? Stress class was very good. Appreciated more sessions were offered, and notes from stress class and sessions.  "
"Access to Services","The time taken to arrange a first appointment as I experienced considerable delays in my refferal which were never explained. perhaps leaflets workbooks could be provided to the patient before a first appointment so that they can at least receive some form of support before the treatment itself."
"Access to Services","Thought session 2 was rather rushed. Would like to do session 3 as I was away on holiday.  The notes to go with it looked very useful, I could get some benefit from it.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Been good but would have prefered face to face rather than telephone contact on reflection."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel I had to choose between Social Anxiety and Worry modules when I don't think I have particular Social Anxiety and my worry is high concern which I feel we didn't cover enough. I also wanted to concentrate more on boosting confidence and self esteem with learning new assertive skills what I haven't been able to do and this is more relative. Even though the modules I covered was, ""Shy, no longer"" I feel it didn't cover all aspects of my concerns and the CBT sessions would have been better suited to my needs if I'd been able to dip in and out of the various topics, to really help with all aspects. Wanted to work as I was recommended to fully study assertiveness modules, but I think it would have been better to cover this in the sessions. I have found there was a lot of paperwork to go through inbetween sessions, whch, at times, I felt was a bit much to do. Overall I am satisfied but willjudge if it's actually been helpful further down the line when I start to try and apply it. I feel my confidence and self esteem issues are still there."
"Access to Services","Be good if the referral times and process was different.  I had one therapist and then swapped but had to wait a little while and start from scratch."
"Communication","information about the service should be more readily available"
"Access to Services","Probably not having to wait so long before an appointment."
"Access to Services","No improvements could be made as the counselling sessions were a tremendous help.  My only comment for improvement would be the time gap for my first appointment which took five months - good job I was not suicidal!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The experience I had with the stressmanagement group negatively effected my experience of this treatment episode. I have filled in a seperate sheet for the group and would like to be contacted to gain feedback what will be done about my complained."
"Access to Services","Not having to wait so long to see a therapist.  being able to have the allocated number of sessions regardless of ""scores"" on a form. to keep patient informed of when sessions are levely to begin. In treatment and its allocation to REMEMBER that patients are VERY VULNERABLE and need all the help they can get."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I would have liked my therapists opinions on what I should do"
"Access to Services","My main concern was the wait I had for an appointment, I was assessed quite quickly and obviously deemed a lower priority.  This meant many weeks of suffering for me when therapy would, I am certain, have been beneficial.  My therapist was however, very good and I was grateful that the type of therapy I received was modified when my circumstances changed."
"Access to Services","Perhaps starting treatment earlier rather than waiting so long"
"Care/ Treatment","Process of getting an initial appointment - lots of phone calls just to make appointments for other phone calls to arrange appointments.  Likely to put people off - a real barrier to an excellent service."
"Access to Services","Probably more sessions and an after care phone service"
"Access to Services","An easier registration system. An app to support the modules, that speaks to you? (Therapist note: we used CCI self help modules to support our working)"
"Communication","A slight loss of contact by other team members, when my therapist was off work. Other wise very helpful."
"Access to Services","I would have liked to continue/step up a level but I am aware with my current situation it will be difficult to find the time and know the option is there is I need it. "
"Access to Services","Longer with same therapist who can understand more in depth over longer period of time with complex life experiences."
"Access to Services","The time to first referral to therapist."
"Access to Services","Waiting time was lengthy but once contact was made with therapist, appointments were regular. "
"Access to Services","The initial wait was to long"
"Access to Services","I think that sometimes more than 8 weeks is required"
"Access to Services","More sessions , leaflet, reading material."
"Communication","I would have liked to have known what other treatments were available."
"Access to Services","More sessions"
"Communication","Should be easier to get hold of somebody at the office."
"Access to Services","Just the time it tooke to get an appointment.  It took two forms from the doctors."
"Access to Services","I appreciate the number of visits must be limited but occasional 'catch up' visits would be good."
"Care/ Treatment","It might be good to get a second opinion perspective from another therapist-just to give different insights."
"Access to Services","It would have helped if I could have been assessed earlier"
"Care/ Treatment","More options.  It seemed to be  CBT or nothing. More involvement in choice of who I worked with. My therapist and I sometimes embarked on a particular line of approach - but didnt finish it before we embarked on another.  Also I was given a number of (helpful) handouts but there was not much time to discuss them, or practice them and feedback."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I wouldnt of minded face to face, however telephone work suited my timetable.  "
"Communication","Talking to someone who would be neutral about my way of thinking and being one side of the situation that caused the problesms."
"Access to Services","I would have liked my partner to be there at sessions."
"Access to Services","Waiting was very long. "
"Access to Services","Waiting time was bad. "
"Access to Services","It took ages for me to be seen by a counsellor."
"Communication","Better communication from initial assessment. I understand the measures I have to take now to help  myself move forward and better, plus an understanding of why I feel this way.  I felt understood and in the long run, I can boost my confidence. I feel more confident about my situation and how to move forward."
"Access to Services","9REDUCE THE WAITING LIST TIME TO SEE A THERAPIST"
"Access to Services","When people first ask for counselling I think an effort should be made to start therapy as soon as possible.  This was something I wish had happened in my case."
"Communication","My only complaint was that this counselling was not offered to me early one when I had my first miscarriage, but this was because the midwife did not inform me of this service that was available. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Having more one to one sessions in person, I believe will help to improve the service."
"Access to Services","feel like i need so ongoing treatment, maybe couselling"
"Access to Services","To ensure that background checks are done over partner/spouse who have accessed the service previously. My wife attended CBT sessions with a counsellor, who I was assigned to. That meant I could not see that person and had to be re-referred which took a further 2 wks. I did disclose my relationship details on my original application form."
"Care/ Treatment","I would have liked a group interaction group, to help make friends and share experiences, think that would have made the course even better"
"Communication","Try to illicit more interaction /discussion"
"Care/ Treatment","Offer more one to one appointments"
"Access to Services","The waiting time for appointments.  Q12.  Patient indicated that it is extremely likely that he would recommend the service to a family member or friend."
"Access to Services","8 weeks does not feel long enough"
"Care/ Treatment","There wasn't really much choice of treatment - more a path that was followed, that is one treatment was offered, and then another treatment etc."
"Communication","Website Support for me with downloads of the materials and links to other support agencies"
"Access to Services","I feel quite dissatisfied in how long the treatment last e.g. amount of sessions overall. I was lucky that I was given two extra sessions bringing it to eight in total but I don't feel that this was enough, I was told that I could go back for more in the future but would have a wait again. I first went to my doctors in July 2010 and after waiting and changing therapy types it was finally finished in Dec 2011. But this was only eight sessions of therapy which I feel is a very low amount and that there was lots of issues that I didn't get the chance to talk about. Now a few months on I don't really feel that these have been much of a benefit to me - my issues/problems are still there , especially the ones I didn't get to talk about - Unsure what I should do?"
"Access to Services","The only thing that could be improved is to speed up the time between applying for the time with a therapist and then actually getting there."
"Access to Services","It was over a year before first appointment with Annabel. It was quick after being put on her list but a long time to be waiting for correct treatment."
"Access to Services","Took so long to referred."
"Access to Services","On a general level - myself and others would certainly benefit from shorter waiting times or some sort of early intervention/prevention of crisis."
"Access to Services","Time for first appointment was slightly long. Level of treatment was brilliant, learnt alot about the tools needed to help myself and when to identify any signs that I was starting to feel anxious or low. The session lengths were good as were the intervals between each session, it gives you time to work with the tools on your own, like you'd have to after the sessions are over."
"Access to Services","I feel that a blanket 6 sessions regardless of severity of symptoms is extremely inadequate.  If I had broken my leg I would receive treatment until I was well not told ""you have to be well in 6 Weeks"".  In my particular circumstances it took me the majority of these sessions to feel comfortable enough to discuss things with my therapist and felt left on a cliff edge after 6 weeks.  I felt I had to rush through things to get them 'out' before the end of my treatment, and there were some things I needed to discuss at length but was unable to do so.  Whilst I appreciate some people would find 6 weeks completely adequate I feel this should be assessed as necessary. Another point is that I would prefer to have been given the option to have a longer period between sessions as sometimes I felt overwhelmed and would have preferred to be able to have more time to prepare for the next session. Unfortunately I opened up 'old wounds' that caused physical pain which was difficult to close and I would not have been able to find a solution in 6 weeks.  I am interested to find out why physical problems and mental problems are treated so differently."
"Access to Services","feel treatment when received was very good but had to wait far too long"
"Access to Services","Feel better in general - wish there was not a gap between IAPT and my appointment for therapy at Millbrook but I have been referred to group work so am hoping that will help as a stop gap and to give me more confidence doing things without my partner.  T"
"Access to Services","If I ever require treatment again I hope it is quicker."
"Access to Services","Quicker first appointment, apart from that, everything else has been great."
"Access to Services","The range of treatments and waiting times is not up to scratch, other services that are in junction with this one are not as effective and you can often feel like you are being thrown to the wolves when at your most vulnerable point. I would hope that any future patients and especially adolescence's can be treated with more respect and compassion by the system instead of being treated just as a number."
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time preferred. Pleased I came as it made me look at things differently. Helps with the worry of life and made me feel more confident with certain things. Felt very supported with overall, health and psychological issues."
"Access to Services","The waiting time was TOO LONG. I presented with stress and anxiety to my GP in September / October 2013 and should have had counselling before Christmas. Instead it did not start until after Easter 2014; this has had an impact on my wife and children, my friends and my work. I have been signed off sick for 2 months over December 2013/January 2014 and have been on phased return for months. With more proactive intervention this may not have happened."
"Access to Services","Dissaisfied that I had to wait 7 months to be seen"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I think the GP's need better informing of what this service does actually offer or provide. You need to look at the waiting lists in the city and compare. I am dissatisfied with the service but not the therapist."
"Care/ Treatment","Cognitive Behavioural Therapy groups were not for me.  Being disabled I felt very different to everyone else in the group.  I didnt fit in at all.  I guess disabled people would cope much better in groups just for them."
"Access to Services","Although it was a long time to wait for the first appointment, I found it helpful once I got going."
"Access to Services","I had to wait 5 months for an appointment and thought that I would get counselling from a qualified therapist - not advice on self-help. This service was of no particular benefit or use to me."
"Access to Services","I feel the number of sessions is not enough. I had an assessment in Newark and the person seen said I could do 20 sessions as my situation was more complex for just 6 sessions. So I am a little disheartened and dissolutioned that I have been given a 6 session course. I do understand that they have to come to a close at some point in time. I have completed and anger management course and a communications course. I am doing a moving on course and from these I feel i could benefit from CBT as to retrain how my brain sees things."
"Access to Services","Had to wait 5 months from when doctors said he would refer me for my assessment - the most crucial months!"
"Access to Services","Such a long time to wait."
"Access to Services","Shame you have to wait so long before receiving help, but Cherie was very helpful and understanding."
"Access to Services","Patrick didn't want to fill in the post treatment questionnaire; he gave me oral feedback though. He said that he is not happy for the long wait for a first appointment. "
"Access to Services","I was not happy with the length of time I had to wait."
"Access to Services","A good starting point but I think I may need further input to improve my situation further and return me to normmal as my problems go back 33 years and I realise there will be no quick fixes."
"Access to Services","Having to wait so long to get started was very frustrating."
"Access to Services","I am happy with the treatment I have received  but I think it took too long between the referral and when the course started"
"Care/ Treatment","I waas diagnosed with depression following several traumas in my life.  The only therapy I have been offered is stress management.  This had nothing to with the events that triggered my depression"
"Access to Services","Lack of info during time awaiting appt distressing"
"Access to Services","from refferal the waiting time was very long and early on I was struggling and needed help quicker. "
"Access to Services","Waited 18 MONTHS FOR APPOINTEMNT. "
"Care/ Treatment","I think it would be so useful if your service would offer counselling for individual family members. I would have found it incredebly helpful to have been offered some sessions wih a particular family member. This would have helped me with the issues."
"Access to Services","Please do not leave me in a drawer again,I would have liked more sessions."
"Communication","Abigious questions on this questionnaire. l."
"Care/ Treatment","Perhaps individual can choose to concentrate on elements that apply to them by splitting into smaller groups that specialise int he seperate elements i.e a group solely for panic disorders that touch briefly on the other areas"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The first therapist I was given I wasnt happy with.  I wasnt informed my appointment hadnt been cancelled and had already waited 6 weeks between the 3rd and 4th appointment.  I didnt feel the treatment was working. "
"Access to Services","As it is an interim solution in the community, it felt quite rushed/unrealistic that I would achieve what I wanted in the given time.  It would be great to have a separate option where say after week 4 its agreed that you need longer terms upport for instance."
"Access to Services","initially I needed help. there and then. but unfortunately it took another 6 months before I had any therapy. This was a major downfall in the system when I needed somebody at that time. Fortunately my therapy followed and continued for several extra weeks, which I was comfortable with and the option of more therapy if necessary"
"Access to Services","Not having to wait so long for first therapy appointment and more sessions"
"Involvement","Needs are different for each person."
"Access to Services","How long it took for his GP to refer him.  "
"Access to Services","Only downside is waiting for the intial treatment to begin, as a bereaved person its hard waiting form slot to be availble. overall my treatment helped me understand my feelings and emotions and for me was a postive step in my life."
"Care/ Treatment","Don't think CBT is for me"
"Access to Services","I think you need more time with the therapist, 3 appointments isnt much time to try and change your way of thinking, its a start but think you need more time to help understand and get into it before youre left on your own to try it."
"Access to Services","Wish i could have more - but i have to job hunt . I will definately come back to LTWB they have helped me in the past"
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to say more on the meetings. Maybe encourage more questions to ask. It is something, but not sure how to comment. More encouragement or force to do helpful things, for my benefit, my own good."
"Access to Services","Maybe flexibility over number and frequency of sessions.  Maybe more than once a week would help at certain times, especailly at the beginning andmaybe less than once a week later on or the ability to extend to more sessions were they required."
"Access to Services","It wasnt long enough, felt like had to discuss too many things because not enough sessions to take things as steady as I needed too.  I needed more time to go though how I felt, I found it difficult going though all the emotions + found I would have liked more sessions to take things at my speed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Longer time allocated.  "
"Access to Services","Not wait so long. Inform patients if the wait is longer than orignially stated."
"Access to Services","Cut waiting list down but understand it comes down to never another money these days. Would like to say the lady I had help me alot saw things in a defront way."
"Access to Services","Not waiting over 2 years. I really needed help at the time. Although it was very good, it would have helped me a lot sooner"
"Access to Services","Waiting list was long"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Lots of emphasis on obesity but not much in offered re: help and support. What is available is very time limited."
"Access to Services","I found the service to be very positive apart from the waiting from assessment to actually getting counselling. This time scale with no other support on offer at the time was very difficult."
"Access to Services","The service should be more readily available and given sooner to people living with depression"
"Communication","Finding the switchboard unmanned at times was a problem However if I did leave a message this was responded to quickly Appointments being local has been very helpful"
"Access to Services","To keep a check on how long on the waiting time span is and to employ more therapists."
"Environment/Facilities","better venue"
"Access to Services","Early access to therapies is essential to prevent long term/ongoing mental issues.  Services should be accessible at point of need & supported by the NHS.  Thank you."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Didnt have much faith that anyone would bother with me. Lots of problems and I know that most of them can't be sorted.Referral to pain clinic very helpfulNO one els has bothered"
"Care/ Treatment","Keep to a non-clinical approach as some people fear this. Stick with practical identification of the issues and supporting the individual to help themselves."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel the service is good to cover so many areas and tries to help everyone that comes to these courses. Trying to help everyone is hard but generalising it helps everyone. Each week cover a different area to tackle."
"Care/ Treatment","As I am required to see the clinician for one hour per session, the session seemed to be very short under my circumstances with the amount of information. I needed to get out of my present depression. The clinician always put me first and was very good at putting me at easy and feeling comfortable. The subject matter seemed to me, to be short when answering questions, one of an important nature to take on board. I would recomment the sessions to be ane hour and a quarter or a half, as there are only six therapy treatments"
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time would have been helpful. Talking through issues made me think about putting myself first. Medical concerns, I am more confident to seek help. Motivated to start doing things tor and to myself. Seeing things in a more positive and different light. Counselling has enabled me to be less negative about things."
"Care/ Treatment","Regular appointments and more intense"
"Care/ Treatment","Course very good but not what I expected  and very difficult to put into practice. "
"Food","Cup of Tea! Longer than 6 weeks."
"Access to Services","None - with exception of access times initially (approx 4/12 waiting)"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","If I needed to self refer again it would be good to see the same therapist."
"Access to Services","More sessions when needed"
"Communication","Could do with a better phone system for making appointments."
"Access to Services","Initial telephone consultation was arranged fairly quickly but a long wait for treatment sessions to begin. I remember starting to feel 'desperate' for help. "
"Communication","Send reminder texts for each week for the sessions, as i forgot about one"
"Access to Services","More time with the councillor e.g. more sessions."
"Access to Services","The waiting list - I waited for over a year."
"Access to Services","Just the waiting time too long."
"Communication","Questionnaire is too general."
"Access to Services","I felt good by the time I got to my first appointment."
"Access to Services","A faster first appointment."
"Care/ Treatment","Having completed the treatment, it became quite apparent that a different form of treatment was needed.  I feel the counsellor who supported and worked with me should be able to make the referral, not go back to the GP which in itself could be a traumatic experience."
"Access to Services","Before this dissatisfied with waiting too long. "
"Access to Services","If my first appointment could have been sooner I'm sure it would have been a big help."
"Access to Services","I would like further one to one to disucss further points."
"Access to Services","Took far too long for you to contact me after my GP referred me.  I had to chase 3 times but my details kept getting ""lost"".  Finalyl got to see someone who asked the question, ""Do you think you've been affected by the death of your father?""  Classic.  Promised to send out information thwen forgot.  Finalyl sent me on a stress management course which is okay but I coult not attend practically every session"
"Access to Services","When I most needed help (ie most of 2010) desparately I was ""on the waiting list"".  I rang the service several times and felt I was ""fobbed off"".  I am just so thankful I have a young son who adores me else I doubt very much whether I would be still here today as I came very close to the end."
"Involvement","Dont feel like this question is relevant to the course.  I would have liked to have the opportunity to ask questions"
"Access to Services","Prefers more meetings"
"Care/ Treatment","Group therapy was not what I was expecting and i did not feel that my specific problem(s) were covered for me personally."
"Access to Services","Six weeks is not long enough"
"Access to Services","for longer term problems I think more sessions and continued therapy should be available as life time problems cant always be easily resolved by 6, 12, 20 sessions etc.  And a 6 month gap may not always be a good idea for a person as relapse could occur on life time problems.  So really each case should get the length of therapy it needs even if it is over a year etc."
"Care/ Treatment","Annabel ran the group well but i didn't really think that it was for me as I'm not anxious or depressed. It was just a social gathering as far as I am concerned."
"Involvement","It was worth being assessed and discussing the options."
"Access to Services","I had a wait an extremely long time to start the therapy - 9 months and in the meantime had telephone (check in) which I found inpersonal and not just unhelpful but at times unsetting. I felt the phone check in was very much a box ticking excerise to make sure I wasn't about to commit suicide. "
"Access to Services","My initial referral got ""lost"" in the system, therefore had to wait longer for treatment and by this time I was in quite a state. Please ensure that referrals are adequately monitored. Following this, all my experiences have been extremely positive. "
"Access to Services","More staff so that appointments can happen sooner"
"Access to Services","Shorten waiting lists"
"Leave","I thought that stress control could be helpful to me but it hasnt improved my situation.I feel I should have been offered one to one from the beginning, given my particular problems. It was not right to offer me this course as a starting point."
"Access to Services","The only thing I would say is the time waiting to see a therapist could be quicker, but I don't know if that is down to staff shortage or over demand for help. Thank you."
"Access to Services","Probably funding, maybe more advertising. It's an exteremly worthwhile service. More facilities/flexibilty with scheduling appointments (later times for working mums like me)"
"Access to Services","I'm very happy with the treatment I got or though I did needed the treatment back in February and think there must be a faster way to get treated."
"Access to Services","Although I understand that there are people wanting this type of service, the time of waiting for an initial assessment to time of first appointment was quite a while and I felt I struggled at this point. "
"Access to Services","Would prefer shouter waiting time to be seen. I have improved a lot with Ruby. She has helped me using strategies to help me cope with situations. I feel a lot more confident and happy in myself. I feel like I have found my true self. My relationships with family, children and partner are a lot better and make for a happier place.  It is extremely likely that I would recommend service to friends and family"
"Access to Services","In relation to Q5, 6, 7; Julie was very considerate, thoughtful and organised with everything we did (Thank you) but I did feel we were trying to move too quickly during what was a very tight 1/2 hour window on the phone. Maybe I'd like to chat!!"
"Care/ Treatment","I only attended two appointments (inc. the assessment) but felt someone trained  as a psychoanalyst was more what I needed, as I had treatment like that many years ago. Howevr, the course Cheryl gave me did prove helpful and I am now putting it into practice with some success."
"Communication","I received no written information but was aware of counselling method used so it was not a problem. There was sufficient time between sessions to digest information."
"Access to Services","I like the effort put into helping me.I don't have to be cured but its nice to know someone's trying to help me. It takes too long to get an appointment, need more therapists."
"Access to Services","Whilst I was told that specific bereavement counselling was not available through this service, it was nice to have someone to guide me theough the process of obtaining that help and to help with some of the surrounding issues e.g. anxiety and relaxation techniques."
"Access to Services","Needed therapy nearer my house as family commitments are very demanding (young children). Had to finish therapy too early because of this."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt that the doctor should have questioned me more initially to decide therapy was more suited to me than antidepressants. "
"Access to Services","I understand the financial pressures and demand for servcies but as a pt with an ongoing, chronic illness I would like to see a permanent service available for pt's such as me. When we leave this service our illnesses wont disappear and has implications on our mental state. "
"Access to Services","Length of the treatment time not long enough. l felt that the waiting time for first appointment was quite painful. If I did feel the need for the service again I would prefer to see this counsellor as he knows me and I wouldn't have to repeat painful things again."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The service did not meet my expectations in that it consisted of an initial assessment/questionnaire and two telephone appointments where leaflets provided were discussed and questionnaire repeated. I do not feel I was treated other than left to read  two leaflets and draw my own conclusions."
"Access to Services","I had to wait too long for my first appointment. Other than that, the treatment was fantastic! Thank you."
"Access to Services","Regular follow up's would be good."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","To be more involved. To be told what was going to be happening."
"Access to Services","It took a long time to get the treatment, but once it started it was really helpful"
"Access to Services","Q2 - Don't remember.  I felt that I needed more talk time in the earlier sessions and more discussion relating to my particular problems, as to a generalisation of the condition."
"Care/ Treatment","CBT works but it just wasnt for me."
"Access to Services","I wish I could have therapy for longer in case my symptoms come back. Otherwise it has helped "
"Access to Services","I really needed therapy to continue for longer even though i understand that i had had a lot of sessions"
"Care/ Treatment","The timing was not the best so I will wait for summer 2015."
"Access to Services","At the beginning of my wait on the waiting list I became very anxious as to how long I would have to wait - This exasperated my problem of GAD! If someone had offered an alternative or gave an approx waiting time I would have been less anxious. I have been very pleased having worked with Sue to help me understand my problems. I would recommend her to others."
"Involvement","I had no choice about the treatments offered. The one day course offered was very helpful but I didn't get all treatment but that which I received was helpful."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Appreciated the help and support offered. Preferred to have face to face meetings/consultations with therapist rather than on phone, as with stress problem, had difficulty answering phone when not sure who was calling. Very happy with service but had to wait 4 months for appt. "
"Access to Services","To have more contact face to face. I had phone calls and I benefited more from face to face. . "
"Access to Services","Felt that I needed to be seen sooner-i.e soon after doctors' referral. By the time I had my first appt I had started to sort myself out. Others may go the other way?!!"
"Access to Services","Appreciated the help and support offered. Preferred to have face to face meetings/consultations with therapist rather than on phone, as with stress problem, had difficulty answering phone when not sure who was calling. Very happy with service but had to wait 4 months for appt. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","To have more contact face to face. I had phonecalls and I benefitted more from face to face. I liked the group therapy and refer to the information even now I've been discharged. My therapist was friendly and approachable but it took me a while to truly open up and she didnt push me but perhaps I wish she had as in my final session I criedbut her advice following this was great. "
"Access to Services","Felt that I needed to be seen sooner-i.e soon after doctors' referral. By the time I had my first appt I had started to sort myself out. Others may go the other way?!!"
"Access to Services","Comments and suggestions - CBT did not work for me. I feel that the PWP was genuinely concerned about me. However, my CBT training was provided in one session. Other members of the Good Thinking Support Group I have joined say that their training was spread over a number of weeks. One member of the group also attended additional sessions on self esteem. It is possible that I may have had more success with CBT if this had been available to me."
"Communication","Never could quite get the agenda. Could be clearer."
"Care/ Treatment","Had to miss first appointment due to no BSL interpreter being booked which delayed the start of my treatment. "
"Access to Services","I expected support to continue not come to an abrupt end. I was disappointed that I was not offered counselling or mindfulness. The only thing of any use was the stress control course in Coalville. Apart from that I only met the lady for these brief sessions. Barely long enough to get to know me."
"Access to Services","My therapist was very good and the only thing I could comment on was initially maybe a little more time to talk with me could have been good as after filling in assessments forms sometimes felt like talking time was rushed but overall excellent service and well done on the help given to me."
"Care/ Treatment","The CBT based therapy helped initially to 'dig myself out' however the techniques did not address my core issues. I was discharged by being told ""you are an intelligent lady. You can find out yourself what you need next."" I had to wait a long time (3 months) from referral to my assessment. This service has not helped me. I am very disappointed by the support I have received from the NHS and now have private counselling at great expense to myself."
"Access to Services","Waiting time far too long - approx 5/6 months. I wasn't given an update on waiting time, I had to call. "
"Care/ Treatment","Therapist was fine but unable to help with my illness; recommended different policy of treatment which I accepted. "
"Care/ Treatment","I think that CBT was not the ideal therapy for me. I have since started psychodynamic therapy which is helping more. The therapist was very good and open to discussion. "
"Care/ Treatment","It would be good if CBT was not the only option and if other options were made available. "
"Access to Services","I would have liked more sessions even if there was a gap of ""X"" number of weeks to put into practice some of the ideas/methods suggested by the counsellor and then feeding back their effect and building upon them. I would really appreciate further sessions, groups, workshops."
"Care/ Treatment","I felt sometimes better to fill in the forms as to what was best to give the impression I was better but I feel as though I have not helped myself by doing so. "
"Access to Services","The time between referral and treatment is too long. I had sorted myself out but waiting three months for treatment of this sort is too long as often the need is immediate. "
"Access to Services","Seemed that feedback after initial consultation was more important than moving on to treatment due to pressures of other commitments or appointments!"
"Access to Services","Sessions/appointments could be extended slightly if needs be to an extra 15-30 minutes. "
"Access to Services","The waiting time was a problem"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I had one session and was discharged. The therapist said things had changed!! After waiting two months for a appointment what do you expect. Waste of my time. Never again. Never."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","When my therapist went off work, the service failed to address my needs. Any/all momentum from the previous sessions was lost. "
"Access to Services","A shame there was waiting list. Needed it sooner."
"Care/ Treatment","I have been left frustrated that I couldn't continue my treatment due to work commitments. I felt that I could have gained a lot had I not been working or had there been appointments available out of the normal working hours. As a result I did not receive all the help that I feel I continued to need and learn about my issues, and how to improve my outlook and self esteem."
"Access to Services","6 sessions is nowhere near long enough and you should be able to apply for more."
"Care/ Treatment","Would like to discuss future appointment, with baby on the way and change of circumstance."
"Access to Services","Some sort of follow up would be helpful. "
"Access to Services","Shorter waiting time would have been better."
"Access to Services","A very long wait to see someone."
"Communication","Make it easier to contact the therapist via secure email for example."
"Access to Services","Would be good if there was an on call counsellor you could reach betwen sessions if needed"
"Access to Services","Took a long time to see anyone, so felt worse and then really did get depressed."
"Access to Services","When I needed help I couldn`t get it ... the wait was unacceptable ... I was desperate... I have a history of mental health difficulties and have been through the system many times. ... what would have helped me would have been to have some ""emergency"" contact/support from a therapist [mini ""hit squad""... like CRISIS but not] in the service, even if just by phone while I waited for months. The help came after the ""horse had bolted"". There`s no parity betwen mental and physical health. If you have a burn it`s treated straight away and then it doesn`t scar, if you have an emotional ""burn"" you have to wait so long it gets infected and then scars.  "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I am not sure what I have achieved so far. I haven`t reached any conclusion or found a path to move forward."
"Care/ Treatment","My treatment was a waste of time. They did not help me at all. The stuff in the letter is all wrong."
"Communication","It would be helpful to explain in greater detail the nature of the sessions before the first session, i.e; when the initial referral is made. It would also be helpful to discuss options for extending treatment before the final session."
"Communication","I have only had a telephone conversation and a letter stating that `lets talk` would not be suitable as i am a `stage 4` whatever that means so i cant answer these questions "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Felt the first Doctor I saw was V. dismissive and not appreciative of how V. distressed I was feeling"
"Care/ Treatment","2 phone asesssment has been cancelled by lets talk; fairly long waiting times"
"Access to Services","I am depressed to a degree that I no longer want to get out of bed I am behind with all household bills/mortgage I have no motivation because of what happened to me, I can no longer work as I did so my income has suffered greatly, but you have ditched me with little regard for my welfare! Very disappointed and disgusted (NO ENVELOPE!!!)"
"Communication","The talk was about counselling that you can offer but that is what I thought I was going for."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Wanted a face-to-face appointment and wasn`t given one. Online courses didn`t help and haven`t been contacted since. Found initial appointment upsetting as felt wasn`t cared about or taken seriously."
"Care/ Treatment","Phone call was late, and there were a few interuptions during the call"
"Care/ Treatment","I waited in for a telephone call and never recieved one on Monday 13th Oct"
"Access to Services","Spoke with maggie whom she said they couldn`t offer me the help I need"
"Care/ Treatment","I went before didn`t like filling out the forms at every session."
"Communication","I received a letter discharging me, then I was told I couldn`t see anyone without a telephone consultation! Then I have to rate the service!!"
"Communication","I wasn`t comfortable talking on the phone.  I would have preferred to talk to someone in person.  I haven`t accessed the on-line service as I am not very good with that sort of thing."
"Care/ Treatment","I was assessed in September 2014, I was put on a stress class course. This course was not beneficial as my stress is out of my control, I asked for 1-1 counselling I then was transferred to a list, I fell off the list?! "
"Communication","Did not realise I had to chose between course and on line CBT"
"Access to Services","My only complaint is that it takes too long to get help. still managing to go to work seems to get in the way a bit too."
"Involvement","Whilst the manner and behaviour of the assessor was excellent, particularly in drawing me to speak on difficult subjects, I did think before the call that only CBT would be offered to me and so was confirmed in my disappointment when this happened. No other alternatives were discussed, much less offered and whilst I acknowledge there is some empirical evidence to support CBT's efficacy I am aware of a growing body or research questioning this (c of Oliver James) I should hope not to be led down a dead end."
"Communication","Would be helpful to have an explanation of the assessment score."
"Communication","Didn't receive score questionnaire  prior to phone assessment so we had to do this during the initial assessment."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Absolutely useless. Just felt like they wanted to go through checklist, not actually understanding what i had to say, seemed more interested in my kids than me. with me getting extreme feelings of suicide to just be told your stressed and see you next year."
"Communication","2 details on the doctors letter are incorrect."
"Access to Services","Worried about waiting for an appointment was told there is a waiting list. I understand there are a lot of people that have problems, but would like to try and resolve my problem sooner rather than later."
"Communication","Some of the questions were hard to answer over the phone.  Didn`t really give you the same thinking time as it would to have seen the questions in writing.  I also prefer talking to someone face to face."
"Access to Services","Taking a little time to get set up"
"Communication","At times it was difficult to hear what she was saying as it sounded like she was using a headset. There was also a crackling sound which at times was off putting."
"Access to Services","More appointment availability in Worksop.   Give longer appointments, 20 minutes is not long enough."
"Care/ Treatment","Punctuality of therapist an issue. Didn't help anxiety when he was 20 minutes late. "
"Care/ Treatment","Unfortunately, there were large gaps between some of the sessions which I think affected the effectiveness of the therapy. "
"Access to Services","I feel more benefit could have been made if a longer duration of sessions were available. "
"Access to Services","It might be helpful to organise an appointment at a time after the course to check to check progress, as the relationship with counselor becomes quite important due to the nature of issues discussed. A check up appointment couple of months later I feel would be beneficial."
"Communication","I feel that I have not had information clearly."
"Communication","A lot of questions to find out if Lets Talk can help suggest that you start with ""whats up, and how can we help?""."
"Care/ Treatment","Both, my GP and your therapist have mentioned the possible use of some kind of medication but nothing has transpired yet, will it? "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Not in anyway sympathetic and quite abrupt. "
"Care/ Treatment","a bit of a glitch wit the first appointment being cancelled"
"Communication","Good an approx time for next contact on letter of acceptance would be nice. "
"Access to Services","Have only had a telphone conversation waiting for a face to face would like appointment near my address or city centre"
"Communication","Wasn't told about range of service or explained what any were. "
"Environment/Facilities","Didn`t like the waiting area at Market Harborough office - not very relaxing, too exposed."
"Access to Services","One suggestion would be to have a follow up appointment 6-12 months later to check how the individual is coping."
"Care/ Treatment","I was just wanting someone to talk and listen to my concerns that I am facing and how to cope with the stress, I was given leaflets and advice."
"Access to Services","would be even more helpful to have slightly longer sessions."
"Access to Services","Q6. Extremely likely.  The only thing that I felt, was there wasn't enough sessions. 6 wasn't enough for me."
"Access to Services","Only really big problem I have is the long waiting list. Would have liked to be seen sooner and have more say in appointments."
"Access to Services","Just the waiting time that needs improving."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","More staff would reduce waiting times. I waited 5 months. When you are desperate, it is too long. Everything else is excellent."
"Care/ Treatment","Therapy has not really been what I expected. I have found it very difficult and it may have helped if I had some information about what to expect."
"Access to Services","I feel personally I'd like more appointments spread further apart, continuing after care also. More catered for specific trauma "
"Access to Services","GP referred me to get some support as he felt he'd run out of options. I felt the person who did my initial assessment was telling me i wasn't suitable for treatment. I had to insist on face to face counselling"
"Access to Services","Good apart from the wait for an appointment. "
"Access to Services","Just wish I didn't have to wait so long."
"Communication","Re ""Choice"" I am still to receive detailed information and further assessment - conversation so far has mainly involved answering your questions"
"Access to Services","Still waiting for a telephone appointment so far no good "
"Access to Services","Not much still waiting for a referral. Just had a phone call."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","OK. Felt a bit like we were 'ticking boxes' on the telephone - will wait to see what counselling is like.
"
"Access to Services","Quite an abrupt ending, would have liked to address issues that came up for me during my therapy i.e. anger, but didn't have time to deal with."
"Care/ Treatment","I think the timings of appointment is unfortunate, half 8 to 5 is a challenge when working, however I completely understand why these are the only hours possible given the lack of resources in helping mental health."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I have replied NO to the questions above because after answering the questions I was told that CBT would probably be the best option and I agreed. The actual assessment was very stressful as I don`t answer the phone and having to speak to an unknown person was awful."
"Communication","Only negative is that when I initially self-referred on-line, I received no response. After about 3 weeks I telephoned and found out you hadn`t received anything from me."
"Care/ Treatment","Quite Difficult to hear person over the phone. Questions related to last 2 weeks, whereas my issues were 2 months previous."
"Access to Services","Reduce time between initial assessment and counselling sessions."
"Access to Services","The waiting period before being seen was far too long. I would preferred to have been seen within 6 weeks of referral. Margo has been wonderful + easy to talk to - a saint!"
"Access to Services","Longer Treatment (More Sessions)"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Some practical help along with regular meetings would had helped me immensely in overcoming my problems, fear, worries etc. Right now I don`t feel that I have gained much. "
"Communication","I understood that the graph is a useful measurement of progress for the therapist but can be very intimidating for the patient.
Comments and Suggestions
The Southwell therapy room is a small gloomy room that isn`t very relaxing for the patient or the therapist it feels more like a interrogation room with the escape route blocked off by the interrogator.
The room desperately needs the (very basic) furniture re-arranging and a more calming/peaceful colored paint on the walls with a few relaxing pictures or photographs.
More thought needs to be given to the first impressions of the patient."
"Communication","It would be helpful to provide patients with more information about treatment options in advance of the assessment appointment so that they can make informed decisions about what would be most appropriate for them. it would also be helpful to provide information about continuing treatment after the completion of the allocated sessions."
"Access to Services","There are 6 sessions available then you get discharged from the service.  However 6 sessions only scratches the surface of some problems.  I now have a fear of ending back at the start because there is no scope to continue treatment.  There should be continuity of say 6 initial sessions, then, once a fortnight, to help maintain the support required.  It`s like treating a cut if it is only partly treated it may become infected and get worse/more serious.  I for one need more continued help and support which I wont get until things fall backwards again."
"Communication","Referral letter sent from psychological wellbeing practitioner states that I have thoughts about self-harming but have not acted/denies acting on these thought; I told the gentleman on the phone that I have hurt myself, via biting and cutting arm."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I wasn`t impressed with this service to be completely honest. My phone call was due at 11.15 and I wasn`t rang til 11.30. I then went through the questionnaire and explained how I was feeling etc. When we got nearer the end of the conversation I was told that what I am currently going through is ""normal"" and I didn`t really seem to need counselling, so the lady said to me about a referral for stress management techniques. At the end of the conversation I was fairly disheartened as all I really want is to be able to talk to someone who can understand what I`m going through. 5 minutes after my phone call I got an answer phone message from the lady I spoke to she explained she had spoken to her colleague, who actually suggested that I would need counselling I was being referred on. I felt I had been messed about in fact if she wasn`t quite sure before ending the conversation she should of spoke to her colleague beforehand.
Thank You"
"Access to Services","My only complaint was that it took 19 days from my telephone assessment appointment and 4 phone calls before I received online link to Silver Cloud, which was quite stressful!"
"Access to Services","I wasn`t really sure what to expect. I understand the pressure on your organisation but it seems to take a long time. a few years ago I had to ""drop out"" before even starting because I had moved house while waiting for an appointment."
"Involvement","As I wasn`t given any options to choose a treatment I cannot say that I had a preference, as I was assigned to a stress control workshop. I am happy to go along with treatment which has been suggested, but if I had had a choice it would have been good to have known the options available. apart from that the service I have received has been very good and responsive."
"Communication","Felt very computerised. No emotions considering it was a psychiatric assessment."
"Access to Services","I`ve felt extremely let down by the service so far, I originally contacted you in January this year (it`s now June 2015) & was told womens aid could provide counselling & their waiting list would be shorter. Womens aid couldn`t provide this service when eventually I got seen by them & so now I`ve had to start this whole process again, I was told by Shamia Ansar that perhaps it was felt by your team that I wasn`t ready for counselling in January. Surely this is the patients decision not yours? I felt completely ready for it. I`m now on a 40mg dose of citalopram (anti-depressants) rather than 20mg & am now having to wait for an appointment in 8 - 12 weeks time at least!!
I would also like to be informed as to what the different questionnaire scores mean."
"Care/ Treatment","I`m not sure about the treatment in terms of time - the appointment times may be difficult due to work. - I might not be emotionally fit to return during the same day & would find it hard to ask for time off."
"Access to Services","As a previous ""patient"" I would have expected to be given an appointment sooner than stated in my phone conversation."
"Access to Services","Needs to be less waiting time"
"Access to Services","I attended a stress course earlier in the year I was promised a call in 2 weeks but this never happened"
"Access to Services","My appointment was cancelled first time and second time they rang half hour before to change time to later on that day which is disappointing."
"Communication","The letter I received although largely accurate two comments were not correct."
"Privacy and Dignity","I would prefer a face to face meeting in a quiet and Private area. I could not hear the person on the other side of the phone because of noisy background conversation!"
"Communication","It was a bit hard to understand the lady`s accent on the phone. I thought it odd she asked me why I didn`t want to kill myself She rang exactly on time which was very important to me."
"Involvement","I would prefer a face to face assessment & it was very difficult to decide between the two treatments available. I felt pushed/pressured to choose quickly. I felt pushed towards CBT. I work full time and it was quite difficult to find the time and private space for a telephone appointment at work."
"Care/ Treatment","Weekend/late appointments or evening appointments would have been helpful."
"Care/ Treatment","Telephone assessment seemed to be a repeat of the one completed on line. Assessor did not discus any options for treatment but informed me that CBT was a treatment that I would be offered but no time-scale given."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I feel disappointed that I have not been accepted for this service, as I feel that I do need some counselling support or 121 support."
"Access to Services","Trying to self-refer was not as easy as it should be. Also I was told that someone would phone me 2 days after my initial assessment but instead I had to wait 9 days. "
"Communication","Assessor had a depressive tone/monotone. Intimate conversation would have been better face to face. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt that the person I spoke to was not really concerned about me, felt like she was just reading a script and did not try to engage with me at all, was very matter of fact and showed no empathy! Felt like she was talking at me not to me. "
"Care/ Treatment","Sherri did not phone me, you said letter posted Tuesday 14th July, you tell lies its stamped Wednesday 15th July. You kept saying someone will phone back nobody did phone back - liars. You told me lies, told me you would phone me after seeing your manager Friday 10 July 14.30 and said I will phone 15.30 no phone call or anything, also said you boss would phone me but nobody did on Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday. I suffer with manic stress and depression and partly blind. Spoke to Emma Wednesday and Annette Thursday. I have reported your service and made a complaint about your service it is shocking, you treated me like a dog. Your service should be closed down. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Just want to be normal again without feeling dizzy. You helped me last time. "
"Communication","The LTW helpline was less great- not very good communication. Was initially accidently discharged before even getting treatment(waited nearly 4 months in the end)"
"Care/ Treatment","My initial appointment was missed as no one phoned me."
"Care/ Treatment","As I only had one session with Anna Graves I was unable to complete the questionnaire fully. Whereas the first session (of 6) went well and 2nd cancelled as my mother needed me, she is priority, 2nd I rang and advised Anna I couldn`t attend as soon as I new at which point she said I should of given 24 hours notice (how could I do this when the situation didn`t occur 24hrs prior to me advisin her?) The 3rd appointment we arranged for 3.20pm when i arrived Anna asked to see me and I went into her office and she advised me my appointment was 1pm? I challenged this as we had arranged all the appointment on my first visit. Her cold attitude and the way she spoke down to me was the reason I cancelled the remaining thee appointments. The discharge summary within the covering letter is incorrect. Attend one session, cancelled two sessions = 4 sessions? Did not attend one session.  To be completely honest the whole experience only increased my stress and I feel had I been talked to and dealt with differently I would have attended my remaining sessions. I will be talking to my GP in the near future. "
"Communication","Having someone available to answer the phone or email correspondent would be an advantage."
"Access to Services","More than 6 sessions would have been advantageous"
"Access to Services","A lot of people need this service, there is a huge waiting list.  I think that there are a lot of people falling through a loop hole."
"Communication","It would have helped me if I had received information pack before phone call."
"Care/ Treatment","Although resources are obviously limited, i do not think that a telephone assessment is always suitable, especially when discussing difficult topics eg suicidal thoughts. It was sometimes difficult to hear the practitioner and lots of repetition was needed. I was also not given much choice in my referral onwards.    "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The questions were repetitive and I was asked questions for which I had already given information. Obviously computer led and very impersonal. Sorry"
"Care/ Treatment","Very disappointed with with therapy will not recommend this service."
"Access to Services","I felt I needed longer term counselling."
"Access to Services","Could do with 10 sessions over 6."
"Access to Services","I was put in touch with lets talk well being in early July, but only got to talk to someone about my mental state in mid September regarding this particular service. They believe that I need secondary care for more in depth support - Also spelled my name wrong."
"Involvement","They said they think I need cognitive treatment, but I didn`t have a choice.  Still waiting to hear about Silver Cloud ON Line Help."
"Communication","I provided scores for the various sections, all fairly low. Resulting in being given an appointment to attend workshops. No options were mentioned. (Other than time of workshop)."
"Communication","I was told twice I would receive emails but they never come through."
"Care/ Treatment","I think the face to face appointment would been much better (understand there is pressure on resources)."
"Record Keeping","It would be helpful to have patients name spelled correctly."
"Access to Services","It would have really helpful if there could have been a follow up/wind down to the therapy. i.e 1 month later. "
"Access to Services","Waiting times could be improved. "
"Access to Services","I find it difficult to answer questions 2, 3 and 4 as I only saw the therapist on two occasions and was then recommended to contact someone else, but I was very happy with seeing the therapist and wished I could have seen her more."
"Communication","At times I was confused as to what my therapist meant when she explained things, and thought she could have been clearer at times, for example explaining thought-action session. "
"Environment/Facilities","Raised concerns over others being able to hear staff, hear them outside make me feel uncomfortable."
"Access to Services","I just wish there could be a follow up on a monthly basis till i am more confident."
"Access to Services","A few issues left to resolve at a later date - 6 weeks was well spent but longer would have been helpful."
"Access to Services","Still in the queue. "
"Communication","I would have liked to have had the different options explained to me - or even the type of treatment I will be getting. "
"Care/ Treatment","Having questionnaires scores/scales seems like a one dimensional and arbitrary measurement! (On letter to GP)"
"Care/ Treatment","I wasn't contact at the times stated and never received the follow-up call as told by the person. I don't know why this service is promoted by the GPs as it is clearly not helpful and just wasted my time, that I could have spent elsewhere instead of suffering alone."
"Care/ Treatment","Quite simple conversation to assess if you qualify for treatment. 

P.S. I shave still not received an email for logging on to the Silvercloud so here is a reminder."
"Care/ Treatment","I am not sure how effective Phone call appointments are - I like face to face."
"Care/ Treatment","The only option that was discussed was CBT. I was asked which issue I'd like to address - either depression, anxiety or OCD. I initially opted for depression but later telephoned to say I'd like to focus on anxiety as I think this is causing my depression. Can someone explain what the questionnaire scores mean?"
"Care/ Treatment","I was referred for anxiety mainly and questions asked related to this and my depression. On top of those issued due to an accident I have memory loss and trouble remembering some current problems. I cannot honestly remember what was said on the phone. Afterwards I remember feeling a little more assured something was being done. But I know I've answered the questions 3 times due to memory issues I cannot say whether or not the reply was the same. I know that I was 'pushed' for answers (not harshly) but wasn't given opportunity to say about my memory issues. Maybe it could be asked on the initial phone call and assessment phone call. "
"Care/ Treatment","Offered CBT despite me saying that I didn't think it was appropriate for me. I didn't feel as thought the assessor understood my issues. "
"Care/ Treatment","I've heard that mindfulness based cognitive therapy is also available but only been offered CBT."
"Access to Services","More accessible in terms of meeting clients and closeness to venues. "
"Care/ Treatment","Required more positive options with where I could see my future life going. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would like to continue this treatment with Leila as I have trust and confidence in her. "
"Access to Services","Long wait to be seen, due to waiting list."
"Communication","There was a very poor telephone line which together with the difficulty of understanding the caller`s accent made the assessment very hard work. Others may have given up. "
"Care/ Treatment","It would have been nice to have an appointment date at the assessment, as someone that needs the help needs that reassurance."
"Communication","More help on how to use Silvercloud would be a help."
"Communication","Unfortunately the telephone line was very poor which caused a few problems. "
"Access to Services","I had to re-refer to this service but I`m hoping CBT sessions will be beneficial."
"Access to Services","Would have liked to speak in person Service but due to a 6 week waiting list I decided I was happy to do the telephone therapy a receive information on Self-help treatment."
"Access to Services","I would have liked to be seen earlier. "
"Care/ Treatment","Only problem is when speaking on phone you can hear other people talking in the office with there telephone appointments. "
"Care/ Treatment","The initial phone call about the Service, before treatment started was confusing. It sounded like a prepared script, spoken too quickly and I couldn't understand who was phoning and about what. I had to ask twice for it to be repeated more slowly and as I was not well at the time I became upset. I would suggest a more measured explanation of where the call was from, etc. Especially as the clients are in a fragile state!"
"Care/ Treatment","Perhaps not being able to reschedule on the day a bit harsh. "
"Access to Services","I feel I could have done with more sessions but totally understand you have to limit them due to demand on your valuable Service."
"Care/ Treatment","I did not get as much as I wanted from CBT as I do not feel it was the right sort of therapy for me. I felt we were going round in circles at times, and don't feel Therapist knew how to deal with me. "
"Environment/Facilities","The actual room used was hot and stuffy, with no natural daylight. "
"Access to Services","It would be more helpful to have more than the prescribed 6 sessions as I feel I would have benefited even more."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The service offers something - possibly to other but not so much for me. "
"Communication","I was asked very personal and painful questions only to be told that due to my alcohol consumption I am not eligible. Shouldn't this be the first thing to ask?"
"Access to Services","On medication. Think counsellors should be able to say when to discharge, as the time in between has been hard for me. So much has happened. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Appears to be a complete lack of communication between Service and GP. Had been referred for Psychiatrist but was given an initial assessment. Completely useless!"
"Access to Services","May be unable to leave home for appointments."
"Involvement","I suggested if there was a possibility of an alternative to CBT i.e. one to one Counselling, but, disappointingly, I was advised only CBT.  "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Your profession person needs to understand more about manners on disabled person I can't shout when I can't hear her properly. She made me nearly end it I will be taking this further."
"Care/ Treatment","I was referred after my visit to Cripps Health Centre for a phone assessment. I was told someone would call me back, no one has contacted me.
The service up to speaking to Elena has been suitable. However, Elena's handling of the interview was not understandable or competent.
I was asked ""what type of therapy do you want?"", I have no idea as I am still suffering from stress, anxiety and depression.
I have low mood, no memory and incompetent at completely simple tasks. 
I would like someone to contact me please."
"Care/ Treatment","I wasn't happy with the question about safeguarding children and refused to give my children's details as it made me feel scared. My children are not at risk and are the reason why I live. I hide my mental illness from them. Maybe the question needs looking into so it doesn't come across like your children maybe at risk because your having a mental illness.  "
"Access to Services","MHT did not offer help
Work counselling was not appropriate for my needs."
"Care/ Treatment","Found it difficult to talk on the phone. "
"Access to Services","Waiting to be contacted to start treatment."
"Access to Services","The first consultant was OK but didn`t give me the help I was looking for her name was X. "
"Access to Services","Sadly too short in terms of sessions offered by NHS. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I feel that a consultation would of been so much better than a telephone call as felt that I couldn`t give my full situation to the consultant"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I feel that I misunderstood the questionnaire, understating my need to some extent, It has been my experience through my life and my daughters that initial assessors recognise needs, but the needs it not met. While my assessors were sympathetic and professional, the overall result of my seeking help has once again been invalidating and discouraging . "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Was anxious and upset and couldn`t concentrate when I was phoned and couldn`t understand or comprehend some of the questions I was being asked."
"Communication","Difficult to understand the caller because of of a strong accent. Very friendly caller. "
"Care/ Treatment","The t/c assessment was a bit rushed which is understandable but felt like a ""tick box"" exercise, not caring person centred support.
I have not been invited onto Silvercloud until recently, though my GP letter states I have. Just a discrepancy."
"Access to Services","I feel I need your help, yet  seems not to be tapped enough. I have sought help for a long time."
"Care/ Treatment","Prefer speaking to people face to face rather than on the phone."
"Communication","On the letter I was copied into - to my GP. The notation on the Questionnaire scores (PHQ etc) didn't mean anything to me. Would have been nice to have it written in plain English or include ""key"" for patient? Small thing that might reduce patient anxiety. Many thanks. "
"Communication","On the feedback form each week, need another option between `not at all` and `a few days` to be added. (referring to PHQ9 and GAD7) "
"Access to Services","It is not long enough 8 weeks has made me try turning things around but not really given full answers on how and why depression and anxiety does what it does to you or go about how to do the changes meaning being advised how to cope with it etc still puzzled "
"Access to Services","Was disappointment to be told I had to be referred back to doctor as this will only delay my time for more support."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Needs to be more contact with the patient."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I felt much worse after speaking on the phone than before the phone call began. I felt very disappointment that I could't get any help."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Crisis team rang and arranged to come to my house at 4pm the next day. They never turned up! What do I do now! You have discharged me - I have no help or support !"
"Access to Services","Dissapointed about the wait for the inital assessment and for treatment /thearpy to start as i feel it would be better for me to start sooner rather than later"
"Access to Services","Quite surprised at length of time anticipated before counselling will be available (i.e 6-8 weeks or more)"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I found the service unhelpfull and on this occassion (2nd time of using it)very unrealistic and too based on a score not actual feelings of the person reaching out for help. Staff member offered no other avenues or options just a refusal ( based on their assumptions and a score )to allow me a chance with a therapist I feel extremely rejected and let down by the staff and service provided further to my problems. Surely the service can understand why it is important for a person to have the chance to talk to their previous therapist who knows there background and understand them even if just a few times and how a rejection can make a person feel unvalued and unimportant"
"Communication","The lady who spoke to on the phone was very nice, so these comments aren't a reflection on her. I don't think a meaningful assessment on mental health needs can be done on the phone. its just felt like tick ox exercise with a DIY suicidal risk assessment do cover the NHS`s back. not much info on each therapy then was told it could be two month wait. I feel at breaking point already so who knows where ill be by then I don't know if anyone will even read this."
"Access to Services","I was not happy with silver cloud at 74 video links are not for me.
It was felt that I would benefit from CBT and Counselling as there as there is a waiting list  for CBT I an arranging to have counselling locally and privately."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The telephone number for Newark to ring  had been given off Rebecca is no longer in use."
"Communication","Would like access or information for courses and other resources eg recommended books."
"Access to Services","Maybe you could consider a follow-up review session 2-3 months after the regular sessions to establish whether patient is coping successfully or may need a little further input to aid/continue improvemen"
"Communication","Please ensure you have your facts - I did not cancel my sessions. I changed the dates."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","This is the second visit to Let`s Talk I had hoped to work with my first therapist to build on the work I had done with her. Unfortunately, she has left the service.
I had built up a good relationship with her and although I appreciated the time and respected the advice my second therapist gave me I didn`t quite build the same relationship.
I understand this is the nature of the service and that there are no guarantees that I would be able to work with the same therapist."
"Communication","I had used this service a few years ago and it was very good, excellent therapist, xxxx. This time however, I found the therapist spent a lot of time giving lengthy advice/examples and had an agenda to follow regardless of me. I spent a lot of time listening + didn`t  feel like I`d really got the basic out of the sessions."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I disagreed with the consultation. The result was based on answers to the questionaire. It did not take into account my not being at work. I am struggling more now with the pressure of work. Not sleeping well at all. 14 hour work day on no sleep."
"Access to Services","Waiting time seems excessive"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The telephone conversations was not personal- cold not helpful. Interviewer/ ""counselor"" seemed inexperienced. "
"Access to Services","Still not been sent link to website/ online CBT, following assessment on the phone 07/03/2016.  Returning to work (PHASED) from 17/3/16. Would really like to being CBT ASAP please. "
"Care/ Treatment","Telephone therapy is poor. It is a call center experience. I am only interested in face to face. It was not an option. To clarify; I was happy with my initial assessment at which it was intimated I would receive face to face therapy. However this was changed to a self-guided web based therapy with the option of telephone feedback. I did accept this  but do not believe I had options. The face to face option was not available Frankly I am sick of web based/telephone customer service. I would like to cancel my appointment on March 15th with xxx xxx. It seems pointless to take time from a valuable resource. I will work out another way. Thank you for your efforts on my behalf. "
"Communication","Not entirely aware of all the services"
"Care/ Treatment","Feels very impersonal as all you can hear is the tapping of a computer which doesn`t make you feel you are being listened to as many questions were repeated when the answer had already been given.  Too formal and felt uncaring considering a persons difficulty in accessing the service. Also the time frame is too long making things feel impersonal but also if someone has to wait this long their desperation for help can overwhelm them and the service is deemed unsuccessful. "
"Access to Services","IT HAS HELPED IN THE PAST BUT SIX WEEKS IS NOT REALLY LONG ENOUGH"
"Access to Services","Apart from wait list for 12 wks for CBT initial phone call.
I felt listened to + understood. Offer of Samaritans good idea. Offer of carers federation for counselling - I rang but they don`t cover Mansfield. I rang Carers Trust but they don`t offer counselling or practical support that the Let`s Talk lady suggested :("
"Communication","I found it very difficult to talk over the phone."
"Access to Services","Seems `long-winded` way of offering me help. Don`t know when I will get offered face to face consultation! 
I did not understand all the questions. "
"Access to Services","I was told that CBT was what I needed. I was not given different option of therapy type. "
"Communication","It was assumed I would have completed and initial form but I hadn`t, not sure whether this should have come from Let`s Talk or Doctors but felt this took time out of phone interview completing questions."
"Care/ Treatment","Was not offered a option, but very happy that counselling was agreed."
"Care/ Treatment","Need to see face to face"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","My 8 sessions were completed over a long period due to lengthy breaches as Rachel was not available. I feel this affected my support.
No option given to extend."
"Environment/Facilities","Maybe a more comfortable environment, soft chair, etc."
"Access to Services","Rather a long wait for counselling but I also understand how busy you must be. Measures and recovery weekly forms didnt always fit in with condition. so difficult to answer accurately. My address wasn`t updated immediately. it is correct now but some correspondence went to old address."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Hugely disappointing. I received a rigid, imparted and dated MBCT programme which, contrary to its billing, had little cognisance to: current developments in mindfullness, cancer specific adaptations, development of most appropriate learning styles. tutors were unable to create a learning environment of discovery, or self demonstrating their own application of the techniques. A ""vessels to be filled"" rather than candles to be lit approach.  "
"Access to Services","It was difficult to initially access the service."
"Communication","Don`t end therapy with warning, particularly with patients with abandonment/fear of rejection issues! appalled by the treatment/or lack of."
"Access to Services","It would have been even more useful to have received the therapy closer to when I had first contacted Let`s Talk as that was the time when it would of really helped."
"Communication","Phone call assessment
More explanation as to what my scores mean
I have a psyc degree so i know how these scales are used.
I think a little more explanation to them would give more ownership and could benefit patients. :)"
"Communication","I struggled a little to understand everything your colleague said over the telephone as she had a strong accent. As far as I can tell I was only offered one option. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The assessment lasted 15 mins when it was supposed to be 30 mins.
The conversation was cut short after I had mentioned about some counselling sessions I had received through work. I had to clearly emphasise that I needed CBT as the session I had received were not specific enough. I got the feeling that thresholds/case management had informed the response of the assessor."
"Care/ Treatment","To begin with I was not aware that my app was a call app until the letter came through. On the day of call assessment the lady was trying to do the assessment on the phone while there was lots of background noises, talking, laughing. I felt angry and insulted. "
"Communication","Telephone assessments are not satisfactory but presumably save money. The stock letter addressed to my GP appears to be addressing me half the time. It is extremely poorly constructed and rather insulting to receive. Either you are sending me a copy of the letter sent to my GP, or you are writing directly to me. You cannot do both in one letter. I can only hope the therapist I see will be a bit better communicator."
"Care/ Treatment","I need to sit down and my heads all over the place. I need to see someone to help me instead of dealing with it on my own, it just does not seem work most of the time. I forget a lot and suffer with my nerves a lot. "
"Care/ Treatment","Could hear background conversations at times."
"Care/ Treatment","I can get anxious speaking on the phone and the telephone screening triggered a low mood as I had to talk about a sensitive topic. I wasn`t asked whether I was in a safe environment to do so or given support afterwards. 
For these reasons I would suggest a follow-up screening that could be offered online though instant messaging or similar, as I think this would have decreased my anxiety and reduced the risk of being overheard when talking about sensitive issues."
"Access to Services","A month to wait between self referral and assessment phone call is quite a long time "
"Access to Services","I felt that after I ended the phone call they should have called me back, to see if I was ok, and continue the phone conversation."
"Communication","Forgot to ask/wasn`t told where meetings take place.
Little disappointed had to wait so long for phone call + now wait all over again for appointment for meeting. "
"Communication","I was told over the phone, had I completed a questionnaire/i didn`t receive one!"
"Access to Services","i am afraid I have found all the phone calls, paperwork and a long wait for a face to face talk quite frustrating. In the 1990`s when I had a very bad year i had an appointment to talk to someone at my local surgery which was made like any other appointment there. I understand from Dr Martin that this appointment will be at Bingham which  can easily get to."
"Access to Services","really hard work to get the service."
"Care/ Treatment","My first appointment was cancelled last minute. But my feelings about the matter weren`t long lasting."
"Communication","I think the letter has been sent to Cotgrave Health Center not Cropwell Bishop which is where I told the receptionist it should go.  I hope it is posted onto them."
"Care/ Treatment","Would much rather have a person to person interview!!"
"Access to Services","Surprised how long to get an appointment to start CBT (approx 14 weeks).
Not received anything by email to work or at home, whilst appointment comes through (as yet)."
"Care/ Treatment","Feeling anxious about going into a group to discuss my problems."
"Communication","I don`t recall being told which treatments are available..."
"Communication","I didn`t always understand what was said. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Been given no help."
"Care/ Treatment","Although I only had 6 sessions, these did take 3-4 months to complete, due to therapist being away or cancelling. This meant often gap of 2-3 weeks between sessions which affected momentum."
"Food","PERHAPS A GLASS OF WATER COULD BE AVAILABLE "
"Access to Services","Please can you amend your policy that you do not have to wait after 6 months to receive counselling for bereavement.  I feel if I was able to see someone earlier it would have helped me through the very difficult times as the support/counselling I received helped me understand."
"Access to Services","Would like to have the sessions last longer ie more sessions.  "
"Care/ Treatment","Make duration flexible."
"Care/ Treatment","More focus on solving problems would have been helpful."
"Access to Services","THE HELP I WAS LOOKING FOR WAS NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE I WAS CONSIDERED TO UNDERSTAND MY ISSUES."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Not very good, Not very supportive, went back to the hospital and they have referred me to some where else."
"Access to Services","I thought I would have got help at once."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I need more help as I`m getting worse for a lot of reasons."
"Care/ Treatment","A very young Lady, who assessed me rang this morning to confirm the above half an hour of my time wasted, then this letter came can I suggest- that a maturer person does the assessments, one more experienced, when talking to adults- she may be using an idiot board, and for all to stop assuming- because we are older that we are in need of mental care. Your service chose one of my good days. Thank you- I do not need tour services. Age comes to all. "
"Access to Services","My only suggestion to improve the experience is to make the process of self referral easier. I was extremely anxious about starting the process, even to look at the leaflet given by my GP. I found the online process very complicated, it didn`t work and i became very anxious.  Having filled in a form online (was very difficult  look for me to acknowledge/articulate my feelings) and not be able to submit it.. At the time making any phone call was very difficult, so having to ring the service and start again was very stressful. i was given a time slot for a counselor to ring me and got very stress waiting for this to take place. No one rang so had to call lets talk to explain that no one had called me..This was addressed and I was given another time slot. The  second time slot I had was with XXXX, who I found was very helpful, calm and supportive. The point I am trying to make is that it is very difficult to acknowledge and address issues of anxiety and depression, to ask for help and then act on it. so any measures which can be put in place to make the process easier and less traumatic are gratefully received."
"Access to Services","The difficulty is in initially accessing the service because of time pressures on IAPT and waiting times, though actually for me I think this delay was harmful and may have helped."
"Care/ Treatment","I think the one hour session limited how much she could listen to what I wanted to say.  At times I had to cut conversations short, due to no fault of her own. So would recommend 1 half hour sessions to begin with then 1 hours as improvement are made."
"Care/ Treatment","Although I have had a lot of confusion whilst coming it is very hard to learn all the things that I can or choices I have to make for myself to be able to make the necessary adjustments to my life by picking the right choices and understand why I am making them."
"Access to Services","Wish you had funding to do even more! :)"
"Access to Services","Waiting time to start seems insufficient "
"Access to Services","Delay in referral to phone call too much."
"Care/ Treatment","It did not meet my expectations.
I wanted help for my ability to cope, not drinking."
"Access to Services","waiting times are appalling. "
"Care/ Treatment","I was unsure how the service worked and how understand the team was."
"Access to Services","I've not seen anyone."
"Care/ Treatment","I have no idea what the questionnaire scores might mean if I was feeling anxious at the moment( which I am not) this could cause me some anxiety."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Would just like to be back to my old self instead of feeling how I feel."
"Care/ Treatment","I don`t think that the phone call initial assessment is good enough for me. I prefer face to face talking."
"Access to Services","The NHS are very busy, but it would be nice to be seen a lot sooner.  I have been offered a preference yet."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","No real advice given on potential self-help tools or techniques, just a standard assessment I suppose is standard procedure. "
"Care/ Treatment","I did find the session quite off putting when all the rules and regulations were gone over. Perhaps this could softened to be less harsh."
"Access to Services","It would be useful to bring the group and the therapist back together in the future to reinforce and reflect on the learnings, i would suggest in 6 months time."
"Access to Services","Would be good to have a refresher session in a few months time."
"Care/ Treatment","I think all attendees should have a face to face interview, mine was over the phone due to later entry perhaps?"
"Environment/Facilities","I would suggest making things comfy e.g. sofa to have a comfy intimate conversation."
"Care/ Treatment","If a task is set at the end of the session, it needs to be followed up at the next session eg: diaries, sleep journals etc. Constrained by time limitations I realise but important to the person who has done the task."
"Care/ Treatment","I just feel I need a rest from it at this time."
"Care/ Treatment","I was given no option to choose a treatment suitable for me. I was told which treatment i'd be offered. I have had CBT before and it worked/works well, I was hoping to be offered some mindfulness this time around."
"Care/ Treatment","Couldn`t answer the above due to so sorry - the only information I can remember is choice of telephone or face to face consultations. Felt rushed. So much information was thrown at me. I felt confused at times and just hoped I understood correctly. Probably my fault - Sorry this is negative."
"Communication","The service has been slow."
"Communication","I could not understand the assessors accent when i was having my assessment. I kept asking her to repeat the questions or what was she saying to me, she talked way too fast."
"Communication","I don`t feel I received the correct information, that was required."
"Communication","I suffer chronic fatigue and me GP suggested CBT would help me better manage my symptoms. Cover letter not very informative, particularly in terms of questionnaire scores."
"Access to Services","Still waiting to hear for appointment."
"Communication","I felt the operator had got information from questionnaire. I`d answered Monday so some things were repeated, a lot of things weren`t related to my circumstances. "
"Access to Services","I received a phone call on 10th August offering me a cancellation appointment on 15th August at 4:30. received a phone call earlier this morning saying therapist was ill and cancelling appointment . I realise this cannot be helped but as have anxiety, been worrying about appointment and building up to it, especially when got up this morning to now have to be waiting for a new appointment and go through again. Not good for nerves at all. hopefully wont be too long"
"Communication","Questions feel ""clinical"", I felt like was having an interview for a job and i had to perform. Too many forms and questions to answer plus i haven`t yet seen anyone. this can put people off, even attempting to access this service. It has made me think twice, rather inpersonal"
"Care/ Treatment","I think that 1st questionnaire answers should be done over a four week period instead of the two."
"Environment/Facilities","My only suggestion to improve therapy is a more comfortable room"
"Access to Services","My only comment is that took five months nearly five to see a Counselor so I`d ""Downgraded"" my crisis needs level by other means. This waiting time is too long for people who are desperate & in despair."
"Access to Services","After many complications with my referrals (ie not having a Nottingham based doctor that I was too anxious to find). I did not gain access to the service until my mental health improved anyway. Please be more supportive of people like me in that situation in the future."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I felt that the help on offer was inadequate and insufficient to address the complexity of the problems I raised during the first session. The therapist sometimes seem to lose her way and for a period of time chose to focus on an area that I hadn`t originally raised and wasn`t a high priority for me.
I feel that the improvement in my scores was primarily due to SSRI medication which i started during the consultation period."
"Care/ Treatment","Discharged before I began, now I have to re-engage the referral process, so not the best experience, no."
"Care/ Treatment","Would have liked to reflect more on past situations and how those experiences have impacted on my life over the years leaving me this vulnerable situation"
"Access to Services","I think that waiting time is too long, this felt daunting and I felt stuck.  I think the wait could put a lot of people off using the service. "
"Care/ Treatment","I was completely satisfied until I received form referring other options which weren't mentioned."
"Communication","very hard to talk about things over the phone."
"Communication","It seemed stressful answering all questions. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I would like to speak to a woman if that would be possible."
"Access to Services","Location at Wollaton Vale was not easy to travel to, resulting in appointments taking a lot of time out of my day."
"Access to Services","Just disappointed to still be waiting for an appointment."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Disgraceful. This service should be closed and money diverted to NHS services that do work."
"Care/ Treatment","I find it hard to understand how people can be diagnosed by answering questions over the telephone."
"Access to Services","Assessment was fast, but waiting for treatment is slow. I am suffering from depression and waiting makes it worse."
"Access to Services","I feel that my counselling would have benefited me if I could have been seen earlier. I understand a waiting time is unavoidable but 3 months is unacceptable."
"Access to Services","I work for well being in Norfolk. They would do referral for counselling, not just get given a number and told you're not suitable for the service. Basically, I have found my own counselling, so thanks for nothing. "
"Communication","Really difficult to understand lady`s accent over the phone. Quite frustrating to keep asking her to repeat herself."
"Access to Services","I wish I would have been able to talk to you in September. I would have been able to pay them for my Counselling. "
"Care/ Treatment","Obviously not a service to help people that are alcohol dependent. "
"Communication","Back-up staff not so good - there was a cancelled session - (Cherie unwell) - call made by Lets Talk & put phone down when my husband answered - I returned call & couldn`t help."
"Access to Services","I feel that six sessions is not enough"
"Communication","Wasn`t explained treatment options of what was available."
"Communication","I did get distressed during the phone assessment but i only remember CBT being offered."
"Access to Services","very disappointed with the waiting time."
"Access to Services","you have taken interest in me, but nothing much has progressed so far. Awaiting telephone contact from you expected in 3 weeks time."
"Communication","the staff on reception or whoever it is on the switchboard often come across as rude"
"Access to Services","I marked NO.4 down, because initially I had what felt a very long wait. This was the worse period as I felt I couldn`t cope and was not receiving the treatment I desperately."
"Communication","More prominent displays on notice boards in GP Surgeries and H/C talks to local community groups ie U3A."
"Care/ Treatment","Not sure the course covered off all my issues."
"Access to Services","Xandra was flexible as possible with appointment times but it would have been good for the service to be offered more locally and with more late afternoon time slots."
"Access to Services","Your service waiting list in too long and customers/patients are left to cope with problems in the interim period."
"Involvement","I was not given options regarding future treatment options but told I was on a waiting list for CBT in my local area."
"Access to Services","I haven`t been able to get onto to my preferred treatment due to the long waiting list."
"Communication","Prefer to speak in person."
"Access to Services","Hope the government only increase funding to improve the service."
"Access to Services","Could communication costs be minimised by using email rather than hard copies and postal charges."
"Communication","The only problem was the phone line was very quiet, at times I struggled to hear and had to ask to repeat questions."
"Access to Services","Disappointing to have to wait so long to be seen by a CBT therapist although i appreciate there will be a high demand for the service."
"Environment/Facilities","The phone connection was quite poor (could have been a problem at my end or yours), this made it hard to hear what was being said."
"Care/ Treatment","My counsellor was perfectly pleasant but I never felt that she really engaged with my issues. I had two sessions and then 2 sessions were missed because the counsellor was on holiday. This was possibly unavoidable but unhelpful. My initial questionnaire was confused with somebody else`s and the error was not corrected. I appreciate that mistakes are made sometimes but overall, I feel that my counselling was not satisfactory. The contents of the discharge letter were not explained at all in the letter e.g. PHQ numbers??? If these were based on the questionnaires, were the completed questionnaires mine or somebody else`s?"
"Access to Services","I felt 6 sessions was not long enough."
"Access to Services","I did feel let down when my first telephone consultation was cancelled and had to wait another 4 weeks for this one."
"Access to Services","Told originally (08/02/17) appointment would be 6-8 weeks away, now told 12 weeks but perhaps it is because I have requested to see a particular therapist (Sara Line) who has treated me very well previously."
"Environment/Facilities","The treatment rooms would benefit from an up lift to soften the atmosphere. The room that i was in had no windows."
"Access to Services","6 weeks is too short."
"Access to Services","It is a long wait"
"Access to Services","I need this service to be longer as it helps me every week to carry on."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel as if i was pushed out and i feel like i wasn`t there for help just to be pushed away and told to go else where."
"Access to Services","The self referral process could be much better. I dont see the point in self referrering to then be then sent a letter telling me to call a number that nearly always has an automated message telling you to call back and when you finally do get through youre told someone will call you back in 4-6 weeks as there are no appointments. Seems very long winded."
"Care/ Treatment","I didn`t feel I was taught to re-think my self opinion"
"Access to Services","I am not fully over various issues, as not enough time or sessions allowed, however Kathy said i can reapply for interpersonal therapy. In approx 2 months time or so.

"
"Access to Services","Could have done with longer than a few weeks."
"Care/ Treatment","A nice idea would be a glass of water at hand and always a box of tissues."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Although my therapy has come to an end i am still experiencing periods of anxiety and sleepless nights."
"Access to Services","I appreciate that the service is severely stretched but I felt like I needed longer."
"Access to Services","I would have liked some more sessions. I was surprised that my care ended."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","CBT and all other therapists can`t cure issues which. In my case stress its like giving diet advice to a starving person. It was worth a try."
"Care/ Treatment","Unfortunately for myself, I needed more in depth treatment regarding other issues at the time. I feel I had gone as far as possible with this service. "
"Access to Services","Whilst I know the service is stretched it would be beneficial to be able to extend the 6 sessions where appropriate. "
"Access to Services","It would have helped me if I had not had to wait so long for the counselling first appointment. "
"Access to Services","From seeing a therapist almost every week to not at all is difficult to me. Maybe from once a week to once a month would be better."
"Access to Services","Time scale waiting for first appointments is a bit long. Then having to wait for treatment appointments is much longer. 
"
"Access to Services","Quite a wait for the consultation, however this is due to high demand & budget cuts and not the service itself."
"Care/ Treatment","Uncertain if this service if equipped to support people on the autism spectrum with no learning difficulties. Not feeling confident. "
"Communication","Think communication could improve as no one contacted me when the 1st therapist didn't ring. He hadn't come in but no one thought to let me know."
"Access to Services","Awaiting appointment. Apologies for delay in sending this - due to holidays."
"Access to Services","I have been offered counselling, but no indirection of when. I understand your services are stretched, but i am left in limbo."
"Access to Services","There needs to be a quicker process of being assessed, however service has been good."
"Communication","I felt the therapist didn't listen to my answers fully & came quickly to his own conclusions, without giving me time to finish."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","Unfortunately for my 1st initial assessment appointment I was driving and asked for a call back so I could park my car, however I was rudely told this could not be done due to the time limit on my appointment. I personally cannot see how 5-10 minutes would have made that much of a difference. Due to the initial contact I was not prepared to re-arrange, however a lovely lady called and another appointment was made. "
"Care/ Treatment","It was suggested by a health professional that i contact you. It seems that my hopes should not have been raised as i don't fit your criteria."
"Communication","Not sure about what happens next. I need help."
"Communication","Don`t think I was told about options. After questions was told was to await an appointment for counselling, which I feel I need. "
"Access to Services","I really would have liked to continue, but i was offered treatment at Ranworth. It is too difficult for me to travel there. I asked for Nottingham but nothing was available."
"Access to Services","Having had the assessment its difficult not knowing how long i have to wait before therapy begins."
"Access to Services","The reason i put ""No"" for Q1 is that we didnt discuss options, there wasnt time really."
"Communication","Your questionnaire doesn`t reflect your process."
"Care/ Treatment","Paul was unable to help me as regard to the problems I have, which we realise I need to have some counselling."
"Access to Services","I would have liked to have attended the Anxiety classes but they are only held at night. It would be good if you could consider holding some classes in the day time."
"Access to Services","Taken a long time to get to assessment."
"Access to Services","Long wait list."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","After a lengthy assessment I was told I was not eligible for your help. It may have been more useful to have told me that earlier on."
"Communication","I chose the online option and was told it would be emailed to me within the hour but I still haven't had it (07/06/17). I checked my junk mail too. "
"Access to Services","It did take along time to book and the problem had moved on naturally."
"Communication","I can`t really tell you a lot. I've only been in contact by phone which not sure if it is the same has person to person, sorry. "
"Communication","Regarding the covering letter that was sent with this form, it refers to psychological health or PHQ9 and GAD7 at the beginning and the end of treatment. I have no idea what that all means and cannot understand  why they are sent to me. Perhaps an explanation would have helped. Thank you"
"Access to Services","At the time of referral my anxiety/depression was almost unmanageable and affecting all aspects of my life. The wait to be seen was a little difficult to deal with but I do understand demand and constraints make this inevitable."
"Care/ Treatment","Need to feel less like ticking boxes and more about the patient needs."
"Access to Services","I think people like me need more of this."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I am still yet to be provided with what is being offered when i go got my face to face appointment. "
"Care/ Treatment","I found it difficult to express everything clearly on the telephone."
"Access to Services","I appreciate the service offered but the length of waiting time is so disparing! I`ve waited 3 months for a call back and now I am on a waiting list up to 12 weeks. Before I see anyone! There should be an immediate service to help people in their present state of need or support! (7 months is TOO long to wait!)"
"Access to Services","I`m sick of going from service to service and waiting a month for a reply, just to be told my mental health not severe enough."
"Access to Services","just a long time waiting for treatment."
"Access to Services","Incredibly slow. I have been getting worse and still have not heard from you."
"Care/ Treatment","Don't remember being offered a preference, but was told I need to see my doctor for future treatment."
"Access to Services","My only suggestion for improvement would be to include bereavement counselling as I understand this is only provided by charity Cruse at present and there is a long waiting list."
"Access to Services","A `maintenance ` session/review every 6 to 12 months would be helpful."
"Access to Services","My only suggestion would be more time/ longer sessions with therapist but I appreciate that this probably isn`t possible. Maybe provide a print out of the graph showing progress of discharge."
"Access to Services","my only negative point is the waiting list"
"Care/ Treatment","Requesting to be seen at step 3 but understanding of why this is not possible whilst engaging at step 4 (secondary Care)"
"Access to Services","Had a long wait for assessment, 5 months, with no support."
"Care/ Treatment","The service was not able to provide appropriate treatment (which I feel may need to be more along the lines of psychotherapy)."
"Access to Services","Been told a 6 month wait for high intensity CBT. Lady said she would call me the week after my assessment so she could speak to them and haven't heard anything since 1st assessment. "
"Access to Services","The initial contact was quick but the referral seems to be taking an age."
"Communication","Ameet said he would send a link to `silvercloud` but I haven`t received it yet. "
"Care/ Treatment","I expected a phone call at 3.30, but was phone 3.00 and had only just returned from shopping."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was okay with the questions but I could do with advice."
"Access to Services","It is unfortunate that there is such a delay, yet I know that I am able to make the best of things; so that will show to the listener that my life is reasonable. I`m aware that others will need support immediately and I know budgetary cuts are huge."
"Care/ Treatment","Some of the questions asked are I feel not right to ask over a call, as the person you`re asking is not face to face so you can`t see how they are affected."
"Communication","It was hard to understand the lady`s accent over the phone
Other than this . . . <satisfied>"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I`d not finished, I was going to hang myself in the work van."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","A bit incompetent"
"Communication","Not given information about choice of treatments - so do not know if I have a preference. You`re the professionals so will follow your advice. Many thanks"
"Access to Services",". . .but not impressed at the 2 month wait!"
"Access to Services","I would advise that it can take months to receive treatment."
"Access to Services","Only complaint would be the time it took to see someone.  From initial call 8 weeks for phone consultation then another 8 weeks before appt at Baytree"
"Communication",". . . I had also been misdirected by the service."
"Access to Services","Longer periods of sessions so maybe 40 minutes as cutting short and returning could be problematic."
"Care/ Treatment","Prefer face-to-face contact - not over the phone."
"Access to Services","I was given 2 options for further treatment but I would have liked a few more options if they were available""."
"Access to Services","Although I understand that CBT is a self-help technique, I do think that 6 sessions is not enough to be able to teach someone several strategies and techniques to help with their stress and anxiety."
"Care/ Treatment","All materials given were things I had already read- scores were lower due to circumstantial reasons eg: a 2 week holiday - not enough rapport  -not the right thing for me."
"Access to Services","I feel that a few more sessions would have been helpful to me."
"Access to Services","There was quite a while between referring myself and the telephone consultation"
"Access to Services","Friendly and polite but very slow which I understand is due to demand."
"Access to Services","very, very slow. I was given to understand that I would be put on the list for IPT not just for more assessment, and I understand that there is a 3 month wait on the list!"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Didn`t get chance to mention everything I wanted to on the phone.
I understand that time is limited though and the woman i spoke to was very easy to talk to."
"Access to Services","delay in accessing treatment due to waiting time."
"Care/ Treatment","It was very difficult to express feelings over the phone."
"Access to Services","Disappointed at the long wait for follow up and treatment to begin."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I don`t believe the contact I received was beneficial, my phone conversation with whom I don`t think was a qualified therapist was negative, unnecessarily intrusive for an unqualified person, and I felt betrayed that I revealed extremely intimate details about the nature and cause of my problems to a lady who although was lovely and polite , was deeply unequipped to deal with y issues and referred me to a service that i deemed inappropriate. 
I do not view myself as a victim, my concerns are derived from the potential harm that may have come to others through my inaction against my ""abuser"". I made this clear to the lady I spoke to but was referred to there anyway. 
This experience has knocked my confidence with therapy based solutions and although I appreciate that ""Let`s Talk Wellbeing is a charity based service, great efforts are needed to ensure patients who are dismissed are dealt with care and efforts made to ensure that are safe and capable of contacting the referral service independently and the ""Correct"" alternative service is recommended.  And especially that patients are not told they are a Victim if this is not what they believe in their situation!!! (At least not by an unqualified person). "
"Access to Services"," Good end result but over a year to achieve it. I found the original phone booking system quite confrontational for people with anxiety issues. Could be more automated with voicemail or email."
"Care/ Treatment","I just wish there were different options available: more than CBT and counselling.
My biggest qualm is: a number of appointments were cancelled by YOU these were the appointments for assessment. If I were severely depressed and needed to speak, you guys cancelling appointments COULD HAVE KILLED ME. + you need back-up therapists to take phone calls when others are ill."
"Care/ Treatment","Although I found the sessions & techniques discussed useful, I didn`t feel that they were tackling the root cause of my issues - bereavement & family issues which I had outlined during the initial session."
"Access to Services","Having to visit lots of different places for my treatment was hard work, especially during the first few weeks. A consistent venue would have been nice, at least initially."
"Access to Services","My main complaint is the length of time it took for me to have a phone consultation - almost 1 month. Many things changed and I was off to uni in 2 weeks making treatment more difficult."
"Access to Services","Waiting time 6 months not happy about not your problem."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","declined service been messed around by NHS."
"Care/ Treatment","Patient being seen at town hall chambers and self referred to our service upset we are unable to support at this time."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel that you are passing the problem to somewhere else. I am suffering with depression and anxiety pre-relationship breakdown and after."
"Care/ Treatment","I felt my initial phone call to Let`s Talk was very hard and not very well managed and could have been very distressing for someone more acutely well than I was."
"Access to Services","Sessions have only a limited effect
Need to be a provision that is ongoing"
"Access to Services","Although it took 5 months from my GP referral to me getting a phone call to assess me for treatment"
"Communication","Discharge summary letter finishes with details of past suicide attempts, it would`ve been nicer for me if this was further up the letter not a final note."
"Communication","On weekly measures questionnaire please consider replacing ""Several times"" with something like ""a few times"". I stopped every time i came to complete it as i think ""several"" means a lot! "
"Access to Services","Understandably the service is working at maximum capacity, although I would have preferred an initial telephone assessment sooner than the 3 months I was referred to the service."
"Care/ Treatment","I felt particular questions/personal should have been asked at the 1st session not at the initial assessment."
"Communication"," Not informed that Dan had left, so quick appt had to be made"
"Communication","Not received emails for information on CBT my email address is ******@******.com."
"Communication","Re: first letter I received did not include questionnaire, had to request one, also no S.A.E included to return this form . Wasn`t given any options re treatment so i am a bit annoyed. "
"Care/ Treatment","I would of liked to be able to research the treatments available to me. Also having a 4 month exclusively breastfed daughter, I`m finding it very distressing that most therapists can have `issues` with having her with me and can `be a bit funny` I understand it may not be as effective but explain this. I feel a bit put off if I`m honest. My daughter will most likely need feeding and that is an issue for me to leave her to cry for food. There seems to be very little understanding or protocols in place as surely I can`t be the only one!? To be told can`t you go when shes due a nap (she naps for 40 mins at the most) or just feed her before you go. (She feeds on demand which is recommended by NHS which could be 5-10 mins between feeds up to 1-2 hours - I have no say what/when that will be)"
"Access to Services","The original waiting time for assessment was too long (although I understand this has now improved). I did not receive a `contract` at the beginning. "
"Care/ Treatment","Feedback received from the patient
I am writing with some feedback as a user of your service.

I recently referred myself as I have some anxiety, mainly health anxiety, due to two serious health scares in the last five years.

I have used the service before two years ago and attended several CBT sessions in Keyworth.

During my assessment I asked if I could be referred to a Mindfulness course/group. I felt the technique would help me and a group setting would also be supportive.

I received a call today saying that Mindfulness was unsuitable for my issues, a statement I find hard to understand.

CBT has been suggested again even though I made it clear in my assessment that Although I found it interesting two years ago I didnt feel it had helped me in dealing with my anxiety. The ""Thereapist"" was very friendly but there was a lot of repitition each week and i couldn`t see any structure or development of topics week on week.

I am sure it is not the intention at all, but it has come over to me as ""We know best"" as the professionals.

I thought mental health services had moved on from that dogmatic attitude and might be listening to the choices and views of ""patients"". a bit more in deciding on treatment. 

I have agreed to try CBT again as that is the only thing on offer.

I am a great supporter of your services and the NHS in general, I have had excellent treatment in the past"
"Access to Services","only flaw was the wait between between initial referral and telephone consultation and then between telephone consultation and first appointment. "
"Care/ Treatment","Structure of NHS talking therapies does not feel that comprehensive - it all felt quite rushed. More availability of humanistic counselling would be helpful. I feel that CBT is helpful in short-term but does not permit long-term growth of the patient. "
"Access to Services","The location was inconvenient - I live in Annesley and attended Warsop Health Centre."
"Care/ Treatment","Hi Karen
I felt i had to write after the counselling experience.
I was surprised how it felt easy to talk to you in the first session and felt that I trusted you. I had come to counselling because 20 years after my son Xxxx died and I still feel like it happened yesterday when I think of him. I felt this level of raw emotion after such a time was torturous. I hoped to be able to have time to develop a way to have positive thoughts about him and happy memories.
When you suggested bringing photos for the second session I thought that would be the opportunity to spend some time thinking about Xxxx, I thought we would use the photos in the session to help me move forward. Bringing the photos along felt like a big deal to me. 
But you had forgotten, I showed you the pictures quickly as these are precious belongings seldom looked at,  that expose a very painful time and my very special boy.
The session went on, I distracted myself from talking about Xxxx by talking about the other children and the session ended abruptly with no reference to him, no conclusion.
I have to say I felt exposed and disappointed by the experience - sleepless nights and visual migraines followed. I had hoped you would have drawn focus to Xxx and I had expected 4-6 sessions but instead I was discharged, I had been willing to travel, but it felt clear that you didn`t think I needed or deserved any more input. "
"Access to Services","The only complaint I have is the fact that I had to wait 3 months and by that time I had got better by myself? Needed treatment much sooner!"
"Care/ Treatment","The scoring system (0-3) was difficult for a very elderly person who prefers to explain themselves verbally. The assessment questionnaire had not been sent to me prior to the assessment, so I had not been able to prepare in advance. "

"Care/ Treatment","For over 12 months now, I have been treated for depression and find anti-depressants unhelpful. I accept I have anxiety and depression. It is more likely I have bi-polar which requires a different drug. I feel un-diagnosed, hopefully your service will improve.
A face to face assessment would probably be more helpful to yourselves and me. Thank you. "
"Care/ Treatment","I did feel sometimes that she was saying hmm quite a lot (after each sentence I said). This was a little off putting."
"Access to Services","Initial responses were a little slow"
"Care/ Treatment","I was a bit disappointed to be told at the end of the initial telephone assessment that I was suitable, to be phoned again 40mins later to be told I wasn`t - although I understood the reasons when they were explained to me"
"Access to Services","The initial wait was longer than i anticipated."
"Access to Services","The time to get the initial phone call took too long"
"Access to Services","Waiting time for treatment is long. "
"Care/ Treatment","I haven`t been able to speak to anyone or let out any of my thoughts or feelings so I wanted something one to one I have not had anything through the post about this?  I would still like an appointment one to one please."
"Access to Services","Initial wait time too long, clients situation has improved since initial difficulties but had no help when needing it."
"Access to Services","Would have liked to have been contacted earlier for an appointment to gain support for problems. "
"Care/ Treatment","I did not terminate further support from Lets Talk- Well being. It was Marie that suggested no further appointments were needed. She asked if I agreed & I thought that if that was her assessment, then I would go along with that. Personally, if I wanted further counselling, I would request that I meet on a one to one basis as I do not feel that telephone counselling is of any benefit to myself. It is good to build a relationship with ones counselor & I do not think this is achieved via a telephone line!"
"Care/ Treatment","""There needs to be a better system at Belgrave Health Centre for registering a patient arrival, as I frequently couldn't tell Charanji that I`d arrive and so often had a long wait for appointment starts. I was asked, on 2 occasions, to do homework (which I saw as integral to the therapy). I found the work both challenging to do and challenging my thoughts and behaviors. However, I persisted and made sure I`d completed it to hand it at the next sessions. On neither occasion was my work looked at/assessed/prepared for the next session. This meant that I got no feedback (trends or patterns) from what I`d done - it meant that I felt that I had nothing to work on and had done the work for nothing. 
At the start, I was asked to complete a 4-week commitment form - which was never handed in (told not needed). However, on week 3, I was told that I shouldn`t be getting any more treatment but, with supervisor advise, Charanjit could continue. My 4th session was minimal - arrive, apologies and go - as the supervisor had my work!
I`ve actually found the referral and treatment process (as opposed to the therapeutic sessions) have added considerably to my stress levels. To this end, I refused the option of step 3 counselling. However, work would like me to continue to get more support.
I was very grateful for being accepted onto the step 2 as I had been rejected as not `fitting the criteria` for either Open Minds or Amica initially. I feel I`m far more in control so it was a big jolt to cope with to be asked by work and invited by Charanjit to move to step 3."""
"Care/ Treatment","lack of information to help you move forward and stop the negative thoughts. Photo`s of a diagram of big unfamiliar words do not help if you are a kinetic learner."
"Care/ Treatment","I don't think they should start the talk with the word mental. I would have been better if they could have started to talk with your illness. !"
"Access to Services","When first went to see Doctor, Doctor decided what to do without explaining to me what would happen."
"Access to Services","I`ve used this service twice. The quality of the therapy has been very good but I`ve found on both occasions I`s no received therapy when I needed it the most. "
"Access to Services","I was disappointed I had to wait as long as I did for initial phone assessment"
"Access to Services","""6 weeks` delay between self-referral & assessments and the another wait for appointment for treatment/further assessment is very difficult."""
"Care/ Treatment","Sometimes felt it was a bit scripted and standard rather than tailored to my particular needs."
"Access to Services","Disappointing 8 weeks to wait till further treatment. "
"Communication","Patient not satisfied with information provided and admin errors.
the copy sent to my GP went to the complete wrong practice. This is assuming is an admin error. Copy was sent to Xxx Xxx Xxx My practice is Xxx Xxx Xxx. My named GP is Dr Xxx and the GP I always see is Dr Xxx Xxx.. This is not the first time that copies of letters have been sent to the wrong practice. I have never been registered at Xxx Xxx. It has usually been when in communication with mental health services too. I would like an explanation as to  why this has been happening. Thank you . "
"Access to Services","the waiting time is a little long winded. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I was referred by my GP for `talking therapy as I suffer severe depression due to health problems.  I have been referred back to my GP without any help at all.  I was told I could be referred to someone who could do talking therapy especially for people like me that suffer with a great deal of pain.  I was not offered this.  I am so disappointed as I`m back to square one with no help which makes me more depressed than I was before!  I was given hope and now it has been snatched away."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","An excel spreadsheet would be useful to record Triggers, Feelings etc, as it can be updated or changed as treatment progress."
"Communication","When first went to see Doctor, Doctor decided what to do without explaining to me what would happen."
"Access to Services","In future, I would have probably liked a longer session (an hour) as I felt 30 mins was not long enough."
"Care/ Treatment","The type of therapy did not address my personal problems."
"Care/ Treatment","Just when you are making progress sessions finish. There should be 10/12 sessions would be much better and helpful. I felt at times the sessions were rushed so certain things could not be discussed properly"
"Care/ Treatment","the admin in very poor. Uncountable by phone. Had to chase for progress. Offered male therapist when I specifically said I couldn`t work with one .Offered group work at a location with high crime rate ( Afro Caribbean Center)"
"Care/ Treatment","I did feel uncomfortable when no one spoke for a few minutes. Maybe this could be remedied by the therapist prompting areas for discussion "
"Access to Services","It is disappointing that I have to wait to start my therapy. But hopefully it wont be too long a waiting list."
"Care/ Treatment","Service provides limited therapy choices, but understand it is due to resources."
"Access to Services","Initial findings very good but long waiting lists for treatment possible due to funding. Information packs for dealing with stress would be helpful whilst waiting. "
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Unfortunately I was not able to attend meetings due to the language barrier and the fact my daughter works full time. This would be rather difficult for me."
"Care/ Treatment","Original Telephone questionnaire is too rigid. In my own case need to a NA response for some of the questions."
"Access to Services","Maybe be a future aim for the service would be to have some additional counselors that for a reasonable fee (like that of a dental examination) could be available to book at short notice and refer more serious conditions to the state system. "
"Care/ Treatment","When I was assessed by XXX XXX, she said I had had lots of treatment and couldn`t understand why the crisis team advised to refer myself for counselling. Also she expected me to know what kind of counselling I wanted, I replied I was hoping you could advise me what was needed. I didn`t know what was available? Also she could understand why I wanted counselling because I wasn`t suicidal! Having a history of being in pain from young age and now waiting for a knee replacement and being diagnosed with Fibromyalgia I think its important to try and avoid suicide. I explained I had mindfulness course which I thought was very good and I still use this technique but when you are in so much pain and depressed because you can`t do daily things like washing and having to cancel social events and also medical appointments. Mindfulness cant stop pain,"
"Access to Services"," just frustrating the amount of time to wait - & no appointment offered at this point"
"Access to Services","I am awaiting an appointment and  venue."
"Communication","There appears to be a note on the letter 8.2.18 that I had attempted to take my life on 2 occasions, I most certainly haven`t and I am not sure that this report is based on my telephone interview or someone else`s? "
"Communication","was told someone would call at 2:30pm and they got the times mixed up. I had to phone at 2:45pm."
"Access to Services","Being disabled makes it difficult to get to some places for Well Being interviews, have to use taxis."
"Care/ Treatment","Initially I attended Group Therapy but I did not find this helpful. There were too many people with different issues that were difficult to address within the sessions. I didn`t identify with the examples used of feeling emotions as comparisons were made regarding Football."
"Care/ Treatment","The only way I could think to improve this service would be to make it more interactive so that each person has someone supporting them when they are using the skills they learned from the stress control group to tackle their difficulties."
"Care/ Treatment","""I felt as though the practitioner on the phone did not care about my experience. He sounded bored and disinterested and it seemed as though he was trying to quickly finish"". "
"Communication","""Not very good you haven`t assessed me someone just spoke to me on the phone ask any psychiatrist you cannot make an assessment of the patients wellbeing from a phone conversation"". "
"Access to Services","""It was my understanding that there is only a (up to) six weeks block of CBT available to me given my situation. I would have preferred something different but am open minded(!!) about this too"". "
"Access to Services","I actually feel like I need this service still.  "
"Access to Services","The waiting time to access the service was too long"
"Access to Services","Mindfulness group meetings would be extremely helpful"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","The ""Rating"" system seems flawed as it only looks at the last two weeks. I`m not sure how effective this is in assessing peoples anxieties."
"Access to Services","There was a 17 week delay between my depression & panic attacks starting & contact with IAPT - this is far too long.  By the time the course started, much of my problems had reduced.
The course was a general `sheep dip` and although it covered some important topics, the lecture/handout approach didn`t help move me on to applying the tools & techniques in a practical way.
I am now seeking help from a qualified CBT therapist in order to tackle the underlying problems.  I appreciate IAPT has to deliver general courses & only offers 1:1 CBT for severly depressed patients, but I really wanted more practically- based action in my case."
"Access to Services","good service but 12 week wait is a long time for people with mental health problems to wait for treatment to start"
"Access to Services","Unhappy with the 7-month wait & if possible would be seen sooner"
"Access to Services","Disappointed about the waiting time for step 3, but understands the demand for the service."
"Access to Services","Shame it had to end as I feel I still need support."
"Access to Services","There was a long wait for treatment,"
"Access to Services","The only negative is the waiting times ."
"Access to Services","Issue about I had to wait a long time for support.
Breakdown of communication as I was willing to travel to Harborough and that wasn`t communicated initially."
"Access to Services","Unhappy, not being offered a service."
"Access to Services","Patient disappointed not taken on for treatment."
"Communication","I felt the admin team gave me mixed messages with name mix-ups and letter mix-ups eg one minute I received a discharge letter and the next I received an appointment with somebody different from Gordan. "
"Access to Services","Would be nice to have more sessions than 4 I had 5 so my wish came true :)"
"Care/ Treatment","I feel that if I had done the PDSQ sheet earlier I would have been referred (to step 4) quicker."
"Access to Services","only downside is the wait time to be seen"
"Access to Services","My only criticism is against ""the system/NHS"" that funding is affecting patients right to full and proper treatment."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","To have slightly longer telephone sessions, by the time you`ve done the questionnaires, you`ve not got much time to discuss things!"
"Care/ Treatment","Very helpful although I didn`t find it easy to talk on the phone. Would have welcomed a face to face appt"
"Involvement","I was not told what option were available to me I simply agreed with the CBT offered to me but do not think this will help me with my underlying problems but am happy to try."
"Access to Services","but very disappointed with the length of time for an appointment. Three months plus!"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","The GP wasn`t helpful. Not empathetic at all. That didn`t help me feel any better. "
"Communication","I asked especially to be referred back to Tracey Dyer as I had been a patient of hers in the past and knew it would be the most beneficial way to go. It took a while to be ""heard"" but eventually we got there."
"Access to Services","The only way the service could be improved would be if the patient was visited at home as that would have helped me more by the person seeing how my personal circumstances were deteriorating."
"Care/ Treatment","I don`t feel that Cognitive Behavior therapy helped so much."
"Access to Services","It`s just the time having to wait to get to see a councilor again."
"Access to Services","Poor communication initially - long wait & then initial appointment cancelled after time my appointment should have been. When came to finally getting an appointment I returned missed call a few hours late to be told there weren`t any again. I was also told I could have an appointment in West Bridgeford for it to then be told to me they no longer did appointments in West Bridgeford. Felt this made the service hard to access - I was still in work which is a good thing for my mental health but this then meant because I couldn`t answer my phone I had to work around work (due to not being able to go in Bridgeford anymore) I missed out on appointments. For someone who really really needs help I was suffering more that I was I felt the service would have let them down - finally got courage to see help to be let down several times prior & this could have tipped someone over the edge. "
"Access to Services","Only thing I found hard was my bad times where late at home so had no one to help or talk to.
Didn't get to the deep core of my problems/worries/relationships with people or lack of being able to.  "
"Access to Services","I was refused counselling because I drink 1 bottle of wine three nights/week. I wanted counselling so I could deal with major difficulties unrelated to my drinking. "
"Communication","I feel I need to mention that I was appalled that you mentioned my daughter - ref dynamics. If she had picked up the letter she would have been hurt. We may not get on but I am not totally opposed to her. Is it just possible to have mobile phone only contact with Let`s Talk? "
"Access to Services","too long a waiting list"
"Access to Services","Tried several times to PHONE for original appt. ALWAYS BUSY - Male person phoned on time. Very Long winded, outcome offered phone call? Not suitable. Decided against this"
"Access to Services","I had waited a considerable time for an appointment and in that time with my own knowledge, I had addressed most of the difficulties I had been facing. I do feel however, that waiting times could be difficult for others with no knowledge or support of how to move forward.
I did feel that my difficulties were not seen as serious, even though they were for me."
"Communication","Disappointed not to receive information as quickly as thought."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I think I came with great expectations and I thought I would feel better about myself at completion - I wish I could write and feel more positive in the above analysis of my time with you, sorry."
"Access to Services","Its a shame it takes so long to get a face to face appointment. Not a criticism, but enough people give you this feedback it can be improved."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I attended not knowing what to expect & came away confused. I feel no better than when I started the course yet my score according to this letter miraculously jumped down from PHQ- 26 DOWN TO 9 & gad =21 to 7. I`m not feeling any change."
"Access to Services","Treatment took far too long. From initial call I had to wait 7 months for treatment, then it was the wrong kind of treatment. Saw 2 therapists who could only give talking therapy which was not ideal for my needs."
"Access to Services","I find your lead times for initial assessment + follow up treatments far too long. It worries me that people in a worse position than myself are not able to access help in good time."
"Communication","No SAE provided. (Hope there wasn`t a different address to return to)"
"Communication","Advertise all possible `routes` of support more clearly on your website"
"Care/ Treatment","I would have preferred face-to-face counselling Lot as the wait was many months. I still feel that i am struggling with grief which Silver Cloud does not specifically address. 
I wish there was a booklet i could download to keep at the end of the year`s use - something for reference - as I know I will hit future stumbling blocks."
"Communication","Have not received on line package so far 8.7.18"
"Care/ Treatment","Didnt want the phone call option as id like to speak to someone face to face.  But that was the smallest waiting list time. Do understand that you are very busy at the moment though"
"Access to Services","opted for computer(internet) option looking for well being email-was silver cloud nearly deleted because i did not recognize the site having accessed the site i was faced with the same questions i had gone through on my telephone assessment? Why Half way through the responses message appeared asking me to -Re-able referrer headers- don`t know what they are enable cookies- do know what these are but it has always been my experience that the question of allowing cookies is asked at the very beginning and a simple Y/N This made the computer option a little stressful I therefore opted for face to face"
"Access to Services","Shame the waiting lists are so long"
"Care/ Treatment","Preference for 1:1 contact; will consider stress mgt in line. "
"Staff/Staff Attitude","It felt not enough time."
"Care/ Treatment","I`m not sure what I was expecting from counselling. We talked about things we could work on but i was never clear what the work was. It all felt a bit random. I felt the therapist wanted me to call on end to the sessions and my scores indicated such, but i didn`t feel I really addressed any issues. "
"Environment/Facilities","My only small concern was occasionally rooms weren`t available on time which was a little bit off putting. "
"Access to Services","I was referred to change point at the end of the assessment so I contacted them straight away only to be told by them that they don`t offer any services to people in my position and they recommended that I go back to my GP. The person who I spoke to there was very abrupt with me after waiting a month for my assessment, I am very upset that I am back at square one. "
"Access to Services","When I was first referred back in November 2017, you though nothing changed, I am now only getting the treatment I need, because I rang you again because my 6 week waiting time was up and I`d heard nothing from you. I had to go through the same process again as you had discharged me, without contacting me first time."
"Care/ Treatment","At the end of a session I didn`t come away from the session with any ideas on how to improve things for the following week. I think this kind of therapy is better suited if you have one specific problem i.e. OCD."
"Access to Services","Earlier intervention would have helped me recover earlier"
"Care/ Treatment","I felt that the assessment could have determined relevant services via a phone call."
"Access to Services","""Still awaiting my appointment""."
"Access to Services","However being asked to wait 6-9 weeks is not satisfactory. My problems are now. "
"Communication","The questions were difficult. I would like to meet a different person to speak to. "
"Access to Services","I`ve been in contact a couple of times. I am having trouble using the service as my husband works shifts and we have an 18 month old. It is hard and the availability of the counselor is quite limited."
"Access to Services","Not enough sessions."
"Care/ Treatment","Patient was told that she would get face to face in her GP surgery. Disappointed with outcome."
"Communication","When being referred the information provided to me was minimal having a 9 month waiting period for the next treatment is unrealistic how is a person with mental health issues go untreated for so long? Never was i told this was going to be the waiting period.  "
"Environment/Facilities","The building at times feels quite clinical could be more welcoming especially the waiting area."
"Access to Services","I know there have been many cuts to the NHS, but I would`ve benefited from this service much, much more closer to the time when I was going through difficulty. "
"Record Keeping","My concern was my initial telephone interview when I was mixed up with another patient."
"Care/ Treatment","cbt. phq9 and gad7 explain please.
Telephone assessment are fine but need to know where follow up`s take place prefer own GP rooms. Also do not want personal information shared anywhere please unless I give my permission. Thank you. "
"Care/ Treatment","Felt that over the phone assessment does not work. Face to face meetings are far better and give a far better insight to a persons personal state of mind."
"Access to Services","The length of time it actually takes to be face to face with someone. While waiting I have already invested in mindset training. "
"Environment/Facilities","I would only suggest background noise as an improvement as it was often difficult to hear because of it and it also made it feel as it wasn`t a conversation between two.  "
"Care/ Treatment","I would like to see medicine recommendation to those are really struggle with mental health issues."
"Care/ Treatment","Both questioner and responder miss out on the face meeting as facial expressions and body response can`t be seen on a telephone conversation. So much more understanding will be missed from the answers given."
"Access to Services","Unhappy due to having to wait until the new year. History of CPN support and due to changing GP surgery she has lost her support network"
"Care/ Treatment","Knowing how hard it is to recover from a conversation in the report.
I take what has been written in the report as actual. I have not honestly thought that there would be such an emphasis on me and suicide."
"Access to Services","The only negative is the very long waiting list"
"Care/ Treatment","It was quite scary and sometimes felt that I might be punished in some way for having bad thoughts - might be down to my own insecurities it was very formal."
"Communication","I really don`t like talking to people about my problems - who  I don`t know."
"Access to Services","I am desperate to talk, been waiting a long time. I would pay but don`t know anyone, I have started having a panic attack, have paid to see a heart specialist."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","OK except your people need to know that a common condition like Rheumatoid Arthritis should be understood as a serious and life threatening auto-immune disease and not  ask ""Where have you got it""."
"Communication","Initial assessment by phone is too impersonal, difficult to talk to a stranger over the phone, some of my answers were misunderstood/misheard.
Long wait to see someone in person
PEASE REMOVE MY NAME FROM YOUR WAITING LIST AS I NO LONGER NEED YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU"
"Communication","It would be useful to know how far up the list I am."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - No"
"Access to Services","Wants CBT"
"Communication","Last seen 2011. Would have preferred face to face as before. Opted for telephone intervention as opposed to on line."
"Care/ Treatment","I want to control things"
"Communication","The only negative thing was that I had trouble telling what the gentleman was saying and often had to ask him to repeat himself. He talks very quietly."
"Access to Services","The staff was lovely but 6 plus weeks for a phone assessment (only available during work hours ) the a wait for any other support with no one to one face to face offered is appalling  service. I appreciate I am low level and rick bit no wonder people get worse and get to crisis point if this is all that available. I worry for those less able/ pro active and more vulnerable."
"Communication","My only  concern that I`m not a great reader and there is so much to read. 
I`m happy and find it good to write down thoughts I am having and what I am feeling but feel its better for somebody to talk to about helping with changing that."
"Access to Services","Dissappointed not offered a service but was understanding"
"Communication","Was expecting face to face. Chose tel step 2 over SCG/Silvercloud"
"Access to Services","I would possibly like more support in managing stress and anxiety."
"Access to Services","If I had to make any constructive suggestions, I would only say that I preferred to have been seen a lot closer to home, as travelling to and from Coalville by public transport took up most of my day."
"Care/ Treatment","I have to say that I did not think I was doing all I was told for me, I sometimes used to do it for to sure her I could do it.  I think my problems lie deeper then I got depression which I am still being treated for.  There must be something there still, I still think I need help.  I need to go way back years ago and get everything out."
"Access to Services","""A lengthy wait to use the service but understandable""."
"Access to Services","""It takes such a long time from the first phone call to see someone""."
"Access to Services","""Delay in initial assessment (due to long waiting list), "
"Care/ Treatment","""After 15 minutes on the phone, Barbara told me my depression/anxiety comes from past trauma. I strongly disagree with this and find it unprofessional to deny care based off that false assumption""."
"Access to Services","""I did have to wait a long time to get to see a therapist. I did not feel there was much help between seeing the crisis team and getting an appointment with the therapist""."
"Care/ Treatment","I wondered if I also perhaps needed a more in depth therapy where I talk about my childhood and learn to understand how that effects how I am today."
"Care/ Treatment","I feel I would have connected better with a female therapist however I wasn`t given this as an option but felt there should maybe more consideration to this. "
"Access to Services","A follow up session a few months after therapy would be a helpful idea - just to feel that support is there if necessary a would give confidence and a goal to patient."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Due to other existing commitments I was not able to attend consecutive weekly sessions. I did not feel disadvantaged by this but perhaps this is not what is expected of the service. "
"Communication","Keep working with other companies and support networks available as all treatment can begin all at the same time instead of waiting for a new appointment from other services."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","I found difficulty applying some of the section to my particular circumstances."
"Access to Services","One criticism would be the `wait period` for treatment."
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Disappointing to be told to contact cruise."
"Care/ Treatment","My appointment was rearranged twice, I presume because you need more staff"
"Access to Services","I waited 8 weeks for my telephone appointment and was told you couldn't help me as I needed more specialised help and you gave me the details for a private company. I am a single mum and cannot afford private counselling so I feel your service was of no use to me."
"Involvement","Wasnt advised of options was told CBT  would be best"
"Access to Services","Length of waiting time, Symptoms have increased dramatically since initial assessment, however no strategies to deal with this."
"Access to Services","Could not talk to long over phone. Need to talk in person to someone."
"Access to Services","I do not know about any other treatments expect the one I was told I would be given. I would like to know of all options available so I can a decide which one is most appropriate for me please."
"Care/ Treatment","I have found it hard talking over the phone not face to face initially.  I am confused because I have received a text saying I have not been in touch to make an appointment have."
"Care/ Treatment","I need help with my Mental health. I do not need self harm or drug reliance help as I rely on neither of these methods nor do I self medicate."
"Access to Services","Unhappy due to having to wait until the New Year. History of CPN support and due to changing GP surgery she has lost her support network"
"Care/ Treatment","I need to speak with someone not on the phone, face to face please that will help better"
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I felt the lady I spoke with to be not helpful and feel the waiting time of approx 3 months to be unacceptable and too long."
"Access to Services","Waiting times for original assessment were quite long."
"Communication","Phone signal poor"
"Communication","However, one speaker phone it was sometimes very difficult to hear questions and this meant conversation was sometimes disjointed."
"Staff/Staff Attitude","I didn't connect well with Sheila and found her aloof. I didn't trust in her abilities as a therapist hence why I didn't attend some sessions. I do need help with my depression and specially my anxiety which is server but I don`t know what is best for me. I am struggling to cope with my anxiety / stress. I felt like I was an annoyance to Sheila at my final session and as though she was in a mood with me. I said at one session that when my depression is really bad I struggle to do the washing up and Sheila replied ``Well it only takes 5 minutes to do``. I found this a flippant comment and it made me as though she doesn't understand about how having depression makes people feel. Like she couldn't empathise with me. I got told  in my 2nd session that in my 1st session I had talked a lot . This made me feel as though  I talked too much and it made me feel bad as though I am not there to tell her my problems. She said I had to only focus on one problem/ issue and felt this was difficult as I had lots and they all interconnected so I felt this approach difficult. Maybe CBT wasn't for me but I just wanted this highlighting. I am sorry to be so negative but this was my experience."
"Access to Services","Would have like to go on a bit longer."
"Care/ Treatment","The one thing I found difficult was all the paper work involved at times added to the stress, but I do do understand without it I would have probably required a lot more in the long run. "
"Access to Services","My only concern was the time it took to get help- despite being told I would be put on quickly due to reoccurring suicidal thoughts. It took my Mental Health Matters representative calling (over 6 months later) to kick things into action."
"Care/ Treatment"," Being group based, everyone was just part of the audience and I only really talked to one person during the break. It would be nice to be allowed to get to know people but confidentiality appears to preclude that."
"Care/ Treatment","I did feel as though I was being taken through a script some of the time."
"Communication","Phone signal poor"
"Access to Services","It is such a shame I had to wait 8 months from referral to be seen"
"Care/ Treatment","I do feel let down by the service.
Despite having depression and anxiety I haven`t lost my sense of time-keeping. The first phone call appoint was 15mins late. The appoint made in Dec was over 20 mins late - this is a real mickey-take and impolite. I arrived 10 mins early, if something unforeseen had cropped up, why couldn't the receptionists let me know there was a delay? My husband took the afternoon off as well to gain some insight and understanding of my mental health. 5 mins late I can forgive, 10 mins is pushing it, 15 mins is bad mannered, more than this and I get too wound up!  I've found an alternative help."
"Communication","My only complaint would be an appointment was cancelled as Abigail was on sick leave. I then got contacted saying my therapy would be terminated unless I said I didn't want it to be, and on my report it says I DNA`d/cancelled one session, but I didn't, it was cancelled because Abigail was unwell so admin need to differentiate I think between a patient cancelling and a practitioner cancelling."
"Access to Services","Significant delay in commencement of treatment (not therapists fault). Delay not quantified and ideally should have been disclosed at the outset. Personally, sought private counselling in interim period as stop-gap to prevent deterioration of mental health. Do not think initial telephone assessment took into consideration which type of therapy may have been most appropriate: ie CBT or other."
"Care/ Treatment","I do have concerns with regards to the initial telephone assessment.  I spoke to a different lady for about an hour.  Along with psychotherapy she said I would be offered CBT for my dental phobia.  I have not heard any more about this.  Please advise, thanks"
"Service Quality/Outcomes","Best thing - ""None"""
