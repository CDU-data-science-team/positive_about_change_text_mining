          It is a standard way of calculating the frequency (i.e. importance) 
          of a word in the given text. It is a little more sophisticated than
          standard frequency as it adjusts for words that appear too frequently
          in the text. For example, stop words like ", "\"", "a", "\"", " and ",
          "\"", "the", "\"", " are very frequent but uniformative of 
          the cotext of the text."))
