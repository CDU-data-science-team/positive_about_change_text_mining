2020-07-06,MI,NA,2,I was kept up to date by the nurses and they answered all my questions
2020-08-12,CP,AP,-4,"I was left from 6 pm till 6 am and not one nurse came and did obs. Or even just asked if I was ok or needed anything. I have also been left on a ward for 4 days. With really bad tummy pains only to be told by the consultant to go home and manage pain at home. Which if that was the case I could have gone after the first day. The consultant advised she did not want to operate as I have had previous surgery on the same side, she would find it difficult to do the surgery and did not want to. Which I feel very let down by the nhs I have a cyst on my ovaries which is 5cm, been in pain for the last 7days and the consultant advised to manage pain at home , I really don‚Äôt see the point in this. I have had a cyst before which raptured after 7 days. So with my past medical history and the nhs website advising cysts that are 5cm or bigger and causing problems should be removed. Why the consultant won‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know And if she finds it personally hard then she should have got someone you could do the surgery."

I was not listened to at all and told I was having panic attacks or that I ‚Äòmust be anxious‚Äô. * was the only person who believed me.  I found this very distressing. It wasn‚Äôt until the morning that the day nurses and * from pain team confirmed the erratic heart rate and took me off the epidural. Since then I have been fantastic. I think medical professionals should listen to their patients. I wasn‚Äôt having panic attacks, the epidural made me unwell. To be not listened to in this way made my first night post op very traumatic."
2020-07-10,CR,SA,3,I was looked after well and everyone was so welcoming and friendly

2020-07-17,CE,SP,4,I‚Äôm Confused but everyone/ thing has been amazing
2020-07-29,SS,NA,3,I‚Äôm happy to be going home but I am very grateful to the staff for all they have done during my stay
2020-06-29,SP,NA,2,I‚Äôm sure everyone works very hard to look after us
2020-08-13,CM,MM,-4,I‚Äôm sure the medical care has been good. (Despite last night when I had to tell the agency nurse omitted the Aciclovir from my drugs and I had to ask for it.)   Communication in general from you has been poor. Eg Surrounding ‚ÄòFluid balance‚Äô some staff seemed to treat it as important and others made me feel that my efforts in this very dehumanising aspect of treatment were a waste of time.  Also 1 particular HCA inspired great anxiety with her inability to either answer a straight questions or say she would ask someone else if she didn‚Äôt know the answer.
2020-07-28,SS,NA,4,"I‚Äôm very impressed by the way I was treated and cared for the staff very attentive,friendly ,helpful and professional. Everyone was absolutely amazing."

2020-06-01,SS,NA,2,I‚Äôve been treated right by staff.
2020-07-13,CC,NA,2,I‚Äôve had quite a good experience in hospital
2020-06-22,SP,CE,4,I‚Äôve never known how hard the staff work to make patients feel so cared and loved for the staff both day and night are amazing and very highly professionals that made my stay in hospital so bareable I feel a million times better than I did when I came into hospital they very quickly diagnosed my illness and very quickly treated me over a week stay in hospital that I was dreading thank you so so much
2020-08-26,CC,SA,2,If gave the answer as I was looked after really well and the staff are kind and helpful.
2020-07-03,SP,CO,2,If I need attention the staff were always around

2020-07-29,SS,NA,3,"In my opinion 95% of staff deserve twice their pay, 5% off staff have forgotten where their compassion and dedication have gone."
2020-07-30,CR,SA,3,In my opinion it‚Äôs like home from home anything required is there if it isn‚Äôt you only have to ask when doctors and nurses come daily to see you they speak involving you using words and phrases I don‚Äôt understand then the doctor will explain in words and phrases I do telling me exactly what has happened and what is going to be done next plus answer any questions I may have at any time along the way then a nurse will return to make sure I‚Äôve understood everything and go over any points I may not be clear about so as I say I know exactly what‚Äôs going on and also a nurse will inform my wife and do exactly the same so she is up to date also having her questions answered as I say I‚Äôve been very well looked after like home from home everyone spot on
2020-08-26,MI,NA,-2,In the pre op information it would be good to know that your child will be anaesthetised in theatre so you can prepare them in advance. It was a bit overwhelming.
2020-07-16,CC,NA,4,Incredible experience that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.
