Communication,Would be better to receive all information on all the available services relation to mental health issues in order to make an informed decision about what was best for me may have chosen more than one area to use to help me with my differet ongoing needs or issues  Initial assessments repetative I completed a questionnaire at GP at home prior to first appointment with Lets Talk and then again at the first appointment with therapists  Is it necessary to do this many assessments initially  I understand about the need to do it for ongoing care but Im not sure about it initially
Access to Services,I am extremely disappointed with this service To cut a long story short I had to wait over 15 weeks to get my first initial assessment CBT session Then my therapist booked me in for his first appointment of the day each week yet he was late by at least 20 minutes before each session He had excuses such as traffic was bad etc This put me off completely as I was already nervous and anxious about the sessions and I was made to feel the therapist didnt even care to turn up on time and he had no excuse as that he ran over with another patient Also when I got my discharged letter through the post the document went into extreme detail about everything that I had said I would have much preferred it to just say things like discussed family issues  rather than a letter detailing what I had said about my Dad or Mum in confidentiality Luckily I got to the letter first as my family can open each others letters Furthermore my therapist was a nice man yet would talk far more than me and did not even ask me questions such as how was your week for me to express something huge that happened that week To be honest I am disgusted with the service and I am very sad that mental health is not taken far more seriously Due to the waiting time I really just had to attempt to get better myself yet I know for others in much worse circumstances this would not be possible

Access to Services,After my first session I was sent straight to stress control but I would have prefered a ferw more one to one sessions as well as the course  So I was a bit dissappointed that I was seen for 12 an hour then put in a group  I think I perhaps needed someone with me a bit more initially

Staff/Staff Attitude,when a hospital professional refers someone with severe anxiety symptoms that raised his heart rate dangerously high and put him in a catatonic state mute completely rigid and unable to respond do not dismiss it all as being irrelevant and decide as a support worker probably with NVQ level 1 that you know better than a senior paramedic experienced ambulance crew doctor in charge at AE and an excellent mental health professional who got my son talking calmed him down and referred him to your service in the expectation he would get the help he needed Also just because the patient does not have any history of mental illness on the system doesnt mean he hasnt if he has been reluctant to go to the doctor to discuss things Support worker X did not even know my sons age so had obviously not read the report from the mental health professional at the hospital  She talked to me like I had low intelligence when I tried to talk about previous problems he had  Naturally she was respecting his privacy but shouldnt a professional have told me she couldnt discuss it with me due to patient confidentiality It also obviously did not occur to her that my son might be intelligent enough to mask his symptoms again it appears a lack of professional training She left repeatedly thanking me for the nice cup of tea made for her and colleague to hopefully create a relaxed atmosphere to get my son talking in the garden with them as he requested She left details of a counselling service with him and said that some people just dont want to talk maybe he will when hes 30 Very useful There must surely be other support from a professional other than counselling that my son has already rejected  My son stayed out all night and was throwing things around in his room this morning but he doesnt need any support according to Jo

Care/ Treatment,The vocal therapist with whom I had my appointment was on leave when I arrived and this led to a wait for my appointment with an alternative therapist
Communication,I dont believe the contact I received was beneficial my phone conversation with whom I dont think was a qualified therapist was negative unnecessarily intrusive for an unqualified person and I felt betrayed that I revealed extremely intimate details about the nature and cause of my problems to a lady who although was lovely and polite  was deeply unequipped to deal with y issues and referred me to a service that i deemed inappropriate  I do not view myself as a victim my concerns are derived from the potential harm that may have come to others through my inaction against my abuser I made this clear to the lady I spoke to but was referred to there anyway  This experience has knocked my confidence with therapy based solutions and although I appreciate that Lets Talk Wellbeing is a charity based service great efforts are needed to ensure patients who are dismissed are dealt with care and efforts made to ensure that are safe and capable of contacting the referral service independently and the Correct alternative service is recommended  And especially that patients are not told they are a Victim if this is not what they believe in their situation At least not by an unqualified person

Couldn't be improved,Not much 
Communication,GPs need to learn to listen and try to emphasise I have got to the point where I am too scared to mention a physical illness I have because my GP has handled my case so insensitively that I have no trust I am on yet another waiting list and have been referred back to my GP by psychiatry My GP does nothing does not listen and makes me feel I am wasting her time she resents it if I take a family member to appointments to speak on my behalf

Care/ Treatment,Sometimes its difficult to get around as Im not confident at driving so possibly help with visiting centerstesting of centers 
Communication,The initial phone call about the Service before treatment started was confusing It sounded like a prepared script spoken too quickly and I couldnt understand who was phoning and about what I had to ask twice for it to be repeated more slowly and as I was not well at the time I became upset I would suggest a more measured explanation of where the call was from etc Especially as the clients are in a fragile state

Involvement,The prisoner would be able to choose what treatment they were given and treated as results able to decide upon their own needstargetstreatments within a system where prisoners take responsibility for their own actions within IDTS a central issue to most they are given very little autonomy  Methadone should be replaced with Subutex as 1st line treatment for drug opiate misuse  The prison treatment seems reluctant to allow IDTS prisoners any power in deciding their own treatment
